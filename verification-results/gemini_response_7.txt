  "reasoning": "This is the Linear Diophantine Equation in two variables. It is completely solved. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides a constructive method to find all integer solutions. The condition for existence is simply that gcd(a,b) divides c. This is standard material available in any elementary number theory textbook and is already fully formalized in Lean's Mathlib (and virtually every other proof assistant). Searching arXiv for this is unnecessary. While the AI will succeed 100% in solving it, keeping it on a list of 'Critical Verification Tasks' or potential research topics is misleading."

lem asks for a general solution to $ax + by = c$. This is the canonical example of a Linear Diophantine Equation in two variables. The theory is fully established: solutions are found via the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and their existence is determined by Bézout's identity. Mathlib already implements `xgcd` and provides the necessary correctness proofs. Asking an agent to 'verify' this is equivalent to asking it to re-prove a standard library function. It fails the 'unsolved' or 'novel' criteria entirely."
