The Collatz Conjecture is one of the most notorious unsolved problems in mathematics. Below is the critical verification report.

  "reasoning": "This is the definition of an impossible task for the current generation of AI. While the statement is trivial to formalize, the proof is likely beyond the reach of all current mathematics, let alone automated systems. Keeping this as a 'solve' task will only result in wasted compute resources. The only viable path is to shift the goal from 'solving' to 'formalizing known partial results' (like Tao's 2019 work), but even that is likely too complex for fully autonomous execution."

roof, and automated theorem provers do not possess novel number-theoretic insights of this magnitude. Attempting this would result in a guarantee of failure. The only 'winnable' versions are trivial computational verifications or mere formalization of the problem statement, neither of which constitutes a 'solution' to the conjecture."
