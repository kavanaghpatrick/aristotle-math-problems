While the statement is trivial to formalize in Lean (`Irrational (RiemannZeta 5)`), finding a proof requires a major mathematical breakthrough that has eluded experts for decades. Recent attempts in 2024/2025 have failed. It is completely unsuitable for an AI verification task as there is no proof to verify. The success probability is effectively 0%."
