  "reasoning": "The problem as stated is mathematically solved and trivial. The Goldbach conjecture has been verified up to 4 × 10^18 (Oliveira e Silva, 2013). However, formally reconstructing this verification in Lean 4 is a valid software engineering challenge. It tests the system's ability to handle large-scale finite verifications. The verdict is REFORMULATE to accurately reflect that this is a formalization benchmark, not an open mathematical problem. Success is guaranteed (100%) if the goal is simply to verify the range, as the facts are known."
