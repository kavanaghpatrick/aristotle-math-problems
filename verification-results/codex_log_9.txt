CRITICAL VERIFICATION: CRITICAL VERIFICATION TASK - Issue #9: Anderson-Badawi Conjecture (n=3)

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Prove that every 3-absorbing ideal of a commutative ring is strongly 3-absorbing.

YOUR TASK (ULTRA-THOROUGH):

1. **VERIFY IF TRULY UNSOLVED**:
   - Search arXiv, MathOverflow, recent papers (2023-2025)
   - Check if this has been solved recently
   - Verify the problem statement is accurate
   - Check for subtleties (e.g., is "bounded case" actually interesting?)
   - Look for "almost solved" cases or trivial variants

2. **ASSESS FORMALIZABILITY**:
   - Can this be precisely stated in Lean 4?
   - Are all necessary definitions in Mathlib?
   - What's missing from Mathlib that would be needed?
   - Rate formalizability: EASY / MEDIUM / HARD / VERY HARD

3. **IDENTIFY PROOF STRATEGIES**:
   - What are ALL known approaches to this problem?
   - Which approaches are most suitable for automated proving?
   - What are the key lemmas/techniques required?
   - Are there simpler special cases to try first?

4. **DETECT RED FLAGS**:
   - Is this actually trivial? (e.g., "prove n+0=n")
   - Is it a renamed/disguised version of a solved problem?
   - Are the bounds too weak to be interesting?
   - Would solving this bounded case tell us anything new?

5. **ESTIMATE TRUE SUCCESS PROBABILITY**:
   Current estimate: 50%
   - Is this realistic?
   - What would increase/decrease the probability?
   - What are the main obstacles?

6. **RECOMMEND REFINEMENTS**:
   - How should we reformulate the problem?
   - What's the optimal scope (broader/narrower)?
   - What preparatory work is needed?
   - What's the best attack strategy for Aristotle?

The problem statement appears accurate, but its broad scope makes it challenging to tackle directly.\n\nFormalizing this problem in Lean 4 is rated as HARD due to the complexity of defining and working with 3-absorbing and strongly 3-absorbing ideals. While some necessary definitions might be available in Mathlib, significant additions would be required to fully formalize the problem.\n\nKnown approaches to this problem are limited, with most literature focusing on general properties of absorbing ideals rather than the specific conjecture. Potential strategies include algebraic manipulation, localization techniques, and exploring connections with prime ideals and primary decomposition. However, none of these approaches have been fully developed for this specific conjecture.\n\nThe true success probability is estimated at 30%, lower than the initial 50%, due to the lack of clear proof strategies and the difficulty in formalizing the problem. This probability could be increased by narrowing the scope to specific classes of rings or ideals, and by developing more precise definitions that can be formalized in Lean 4.\n\nRed flags include the broadness of the problem, the lack of established approaches, and the difficulty in formalization. To maximize the chances of success, it is recommended to reformulate the problem by focusing on specific cases or classes of rings, and to conduct preparatory work to develop the necessary formal definitions and explore related results in the literature.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":618,"completion_tokens":720,"total_tokens":1338,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":618,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}

**Summarizing Anderson-Badawi Conjecture background and reasoning**

I'm gathering and organizing all relevant knowledge about n-absorbing ideals and the Anderson-Badawi Conjecture, including definitions, known results for small n, open problems for larger n, and references to key papers. I’m preparing thorough reasoning for the final output while considering that writing to a file might fail due to read-only restrictions, and planning to verify what info I can from local resources.

**Evaluating n-absorbing ideal conjectures**

I'm gathering and reasoning through existing knowledge about n-absorbing and strongly n-absorbing ideals, focusing especially on the case n=3. I know there's partial progress for special rings like u-rings, but the full conjecture remains open in general, so I'll carefully summarize known results, possible counterexamples, and references to give a thorough evaluation.

The problem statement appears accurate, but its broad scope makes it challenging to tackle directly.\n\nFormalizing this problem in Lean 4 is rated as HARD due to the complexity of defining and working with 3-absorbing and strongly 3-absorbing ideals. While some necessary definitions might be available in Mathlib, significant additions would be required to fully formalize the problem.\n\nKnown approaches to this problem are limited, with most literature focusing on general properties of absorbing ideals rather than the specific conjecture. Potential strategies include algebraic manipulation, localization techniques, and exploring connections with prime ideals and primary decomposition. However, none of these approaches have been fully developed for this specific conjecture.\n\nThe true success probability is estimated at 30%, lower than the initial 50%, due to the lack of clear proof strategies and the difficulty in formalizing the problem. This probability could be increased by narrowing the scope to specific classes of rings or ideals, and by developing more precise definitions that can be formalized in Lean 4.\n\nRed flags include the broadness of the problem, the lack of established approaches, and the difficulty in formalization. To maximize the chances of success, it is recommended to reformulate the problem by focusing on specific cases or classes of rings, and to conduct preparatory work to develop the necessary formal definitions and explore related results in the literature.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":618,"completion_tokens":720,"total_tokens":1338,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":618,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}

**Summarizing conjecture status and literature**

I’m gathering thorough reasoning that explains the n=3 absorbing ideal conjecture remains unresolved as of recent literature, carefully referencing known authors and publications while acknowledging my environment limits live searches. I want to highlight definitional nuances, partial results for special ring classes, potential proof strategies, key obstacles, and recommendations—all to produce a detailed JSON verdict with confidence and next steps.
**Crafting detailed final JSON plan**

I’m putting together the comprehensive final content for the JSON output: justifying the conjecture remains open, formalizability challenges, proof strategies, obstacles, red flags, refinements, preparatory steps, and detailed reasoning citing known literature while noting network limits. I'll prepare a Python script snippet to attempt writing this JSON to the expected file path, though write permissions might be uncertain in this environment.

**Handling read-only environment constraints**

It looks like running python commands triggers pyenv hooks that try to write to restricted directories, causing failures. I want to bypass pyenv by calling the system python directly (like `/usr/bin/python3`) via a shell command without heredoc usage, to avoid temp file creation that isn’t permitted. I’ll test running a simple command this way to see if it works despite the read-only root restrictions.

**Assessment**
- Compiled a full literature/strategy review of the Anderson-Badawi n=3 conjecture and concluded it remains open outside the known special classes (u-rings, Prüfer/arithmetic, certain Noetherian/Artinian cases); no evidence of a 2023–2025 breakthrough surfaced in the local materials, and network searches are impossible in this read-only sandbox.
- The issue text itself is incorrect: `create_all_issues.py:197` defines “3‑absorbing” with only three factors (the 2‑absorbing property) and omits the “proper ideal” requirement, so the current statement is already settled and does not match the conjecture of Anderson–Badawi.
- I attempted to write the mandated report to `verification-results/codex_result_9.md`, but the filesystem is read-only (see failed write attempt above). The full JSON result is provided below so it can be saved manually.

  ],
  "reasoning": "Anderson and Badawi introduced n-absorbing ideals in 2009 (Comm. Algebra 39) and conjectured that every n-absorbing ideal is strongly n-absorbing. They verified the equivalence for n=2, but for n>=3 only partial results are known: various later papers (for example Badawi and Tekir and their collaborators through 2022) show the conjecture for special classes such as u-rings, Prufer or arithmetic rings, and some Noetherian or Artinian settings, while still listing the general n=3 case as open. This repository contains no mention of a post-2023 breakthrough, and in this sandbox I cannot run a fresh arXiv or MathOverflow search, so the prudent assumption is that the conjecture remains unsolved.\n\nThe issue text currently misstates the problem (it gives the 2-absorbing condition) and omits the requirement that I be proper. Without correcting that, we are either restating a settled theorem or chasing the wrong target. Even after fixing the statement, the plan is vague: there is no catalogue of partial results, no structural invariant to attack, and no counterexample search. Strongly 3-absorbing involves arbitrary products of ideals, so purely symbolic automation offers little leverage, and there is no evidence that the conjecture is even true in general.\n\nLean can express the statement because ideals and their products already exist in Mathlib, but n-absorbing notions are absent, so a fair amount of groundwork would be needed before any proof attempt. Given a decade of stalled progress and the lack of a concrete attack plan, the true success probability is closer to 15% than the advertised 50%. Raising it would require (i) correcting and narrowing the conjecture to a tractable ring class or (ii) launching a systematic search for counterexamples in small rings."

**Next Steps**
1. Fix the problem statement across the repo (e.g., `create_all_issues.py:197`, `TOP_10_PROBLEMS_QUICKSTART.md:65`) so it matches the actual n=3 conjecture and explicitly restricts to proper ideals.
2. Decide whether to pursue a restricted class (Noetherian local, Artinian, finite) or a counterexample search, and gather the needed references/tooling accordingly.
