  "reasoning": "The specific problem requested (Every 3-absorbing ideal is strongly 3-absorbing) is no longer an open problem. It was proven generally for all n by Spencer Secord in 2023/2024. Therefore, it fails the primary criterion of being an unsolved mathematical research problem. Anderson-Badawi Conjecture 3 (regarding polynomial rings) appears to still be open for n >= 3 and would be a suitable replacement."
