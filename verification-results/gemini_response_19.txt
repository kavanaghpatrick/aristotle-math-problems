While the problem statement is easy to formalize, the solution is unknown to humanity. The agent can, however, contribute meaningfully by formalizing the *known* results, which is a non-trivial and valuable software engineering/math task. The 10% success estimate for *solving* it is wildly optimistic; 0.1% is more realistic. Success for *formalizing known bounds* is high (80%)."
