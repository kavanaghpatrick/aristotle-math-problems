Retrying after 248.974883ms...The problem "Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem" is a classical solved problem (1770) and is already formalized in the Lean 4 library (Mathlib). It is not an unsolved research problem.

    "Classical theorem proved by Lagrange in 1770",

    "The 3-square theorem is significantly harder to formalize than the 4-square theorem and involves more complex number theoretic machinery (quadratic forms) which may not be fully ready in Mathlib."

  "reasoning": "This is a misclassification of a standard, solved theorem as an open problem. The core theorem (Lagrange's) is already in the library. The secondary part (Legendre's) is solved mathematically but potentially an interesting (though hard) formalization target. It fails the 'Unsolved' criterion completely."
