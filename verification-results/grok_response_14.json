However, the current problem statement might be too broad to be interesting or feasible within a reasonable timeframe. The requirement of 'at least 4 primes' between p_n² and p_{n+1}² is stringent and may not hold for all n within the specified range, which could make the problem less interesting if it fails for even a single case. \n\nFormalizing this problem in Lean 4 would be hard due to the complexity of prime number theory and the need for extensive definitions and lemmas in Mathlib. The current success probability of 70% seems overly optimistic given the challenges involved, and a more realistic estimate is 30%. \n\nTo increase the success probability, the problem should be reformulated to a more manageable scope, such as a smaller range of n or a weaker condition on the number of primes. A thorough literature review is essential to ensure no recent progress has been overlooked. The most promising proof strategies involve a combination of analytic number theory, computational verification, and probabilistic methods. Key obstacles include the large range of n and the stringent condition on the number of primes. Preparatory steps should focus on developing efficient algorithms and reviewing existing literature.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":646,"completion_tokens":704,"total_tokens":1350,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":646,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
