## Original Goal
Deep research on Erdos 364 frontier: what's provable beyond mod 36, what Chan/She 2025 achieved, ABC conditional approaches, and identify best sketch targets for INFORMAL submission.

## Learnings
- Chan (2025 INTEGERS #A7) ruled out cube-centered triples with p^3*y^2 flanking using Pell equation u^2-3v^2=-2 and elliptic curves Y^2=X^3+/-3X^2+9X
- She (2025 INTEGERS #A103) ruled out cube-centered triples with p^2*a^3 flanking using Mordell curves (u^2+u+1=v^3 has only 4 solutions) and Thue equations
- Combined: cube-centered triples with single-prime odd-exponent flanking are fully excluded, but multi-prime and non-cube cases remain wide open
- ABC-conditional finiteness works via (n+1)^2 = n(n+2)+1 decomposition: rad(n(n+1)(n+2)) <= n^{3/2} for powerful n,n+1,n+2, so ABC with eps<1/3 gives contradiction for large n
- The modular sieve approach with primes {2,3,5,7} gives 1209 survivors mod 44100 (PROVEN in Lean). Adding prime 11 would give modulus 5336100 — feasibility unknown
- She's paper conjectures: x^n - 1 is never powerful for x>1, n>2. This would subsume the cube-center case and strengthens Catalan/Mihailescu
- The general (non-cube-center) case has NO structural handle — no algebraic factorization available, unlike x^3+/-1
- Consecutive powerful PAIRS from Pell equations provide infinite families. Triples require overlapping pairs — could target specific Pell families
- Key Mordell/Thue results needed: u^2+u+1=v^3 (4 solutions), u^3-v^3=2 (1 solution), u^3-2v^3=1 — all classically known
- Computational bound 10^22 claimed but not Lean-verified; our 10^8 bound IS Lean-verified
