## Original Goal

Research the open frontier of the Sierpinski conjecture (5/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z for all n >= 2). Identify what's proven, what's genuinely open, and develop an approach for a proof sketch targeting the hard cases.

## Current Phase

Research complete. Ready for sketch.

## Learnings

- Sierpinski conjecture verified to 10^18 with NO exceptions (arXiv:2511.16817, Nov 2025)
- Schinzel's general conjecture (m/n for all m >= 4) FAILS for m >= 6.52*10^9, but m=4 and m=5 appear special
- arXiv:2508.07367 reduces entire 5/n conjecture to ONE case: n = 5q+1 where 252|q
- 252 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 arises as LCM of cascade: mod 5 -> mod 12 -> mod 84 -> mod 252
- The key polynomial p_1(x,y,z) = z(x(5y-1)-y)-x generates all solved q values
- Conjecture: image of p_1 contains all multiples of 252 (verified to ~2*10^10)
- For x=1: p_1(1,y,z) = z(4y-1)-1. Need z(4y-1) = 252L+1. Works when 252L+1 has a prime factor p = 3 mod 4.
- The obstruction: if 252L+1 has ALL prime factors = 1 mod 4. This is density-zero but hard to rule out unconditionally.
- We already have slot626 proving the trivial cases (2|n, 3|n, 5|n) and slot604 for 4/n structural results.
- The polynomial coverage approach is genuinely novel -- no formalization of the parametric reduction exists.
- Elsholtz-Tao classify solutions as Type I (n|x) and Type II (n|y, n|z). For m=5, all primes < 10^13 have Type II solutions.
