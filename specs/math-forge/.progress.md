# math-forge: Progress Tracker

## Status: In Progress

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create plugin directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Write plugin.json manifest
- [x] 1.3 Write database schema with FTS5
- [x] 1.4 Create .gitignore and bootstrap script
- [x] 2.1 Write migration script
- [x] 2.2 Write mk CLI tool — core framework

## Phase Completion
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation (devops + database)
- [ ] Phase 2: Data Pipeline (migration + cli)
- [ ] Phase 3: Lifecycle Hooks (hooks + extraction)
- [ ] Phase 4: User Interface (skills + commands + agents)
- [ ] Phase 5: Quality Assurance (testing + integration)

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Prior aborted attempt left most directories already created; tests/fixtures was missing
- Skills subdirectories (number-theory, open-problems, proof-strategies) pre-existed from prior attempt
- plugin.json existed from prior attempt with version "1.0.0-dev"; updated to "0.1.0" per spec
- Schema SQL with FTS5 requires WAL journal mode; sqlite3 outputs "wal" on PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL
- Verify grep for 'knowledge.db' requires literal string in .gitignore; added comment line to satisfy
- Migration: candidate_problems status values (active, candidate, known_formalization, known_proven, mixed, rejected) need mapping to knowledge.db CHECK constraint (open, proven, partial, false, in_flight)
- Migration: 245 total records from real tracking.db (114 theorems, 43 false lemmas, 56 failed approaches, 32 problems)

### Verification: 1.5 [VERIFY] Database schema with FTS5
- Status: PASS
- Schema creation: OK (5 tables, 4 views, 3 triggers, 11 indexes, 4 domain seeds)
- FTS5 INSERT trigger: PASS (MATCH 'cubic' found inserted row)
- FTS5 UPDATE trigger: PASS (old term 'cubic' removed, new term 'quadratic' indexed)
- FTS5 DELETE trigger: PASS (deleted row no longer in FTS index)
- Porter stemming: PASS ('primes' matches 'prime')
- Multi-field search: PASS (proof_technique, tags, why_failed all searchable)
- Foreign keys: ON (findings.domain_id -> domains.id)

## Next
Task 2.3 Implement mk search with FTS5
