# math-forge: Progress Tracker

## Status: In Progress

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create plugin directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Write plugin.json manifest
- [x] 1.3 Write database schema with FTS5
- [x] 1.4 Create .gitignore and bootstrap script

## Phase Completion
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation (devops + database)
- [ ] Phase 2: Data Pipeline (migration + cli)
- [ ] Phase 3: Lifecycle Hooks (hooks + extraction)
- [ ] Phase 4: User Interface (skills + commands + agents)
- [ ] Phase 5: Quality Assurance (testing + integration)

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Prior aborted attempt left most directories already created; tests/fixtures was missing
- Skills subdirectories (number-theory, open-problems, proof-strategies) pre-existed from prior attempt
- plugin.json existed from prior attempt with version "1.0.0-dev"; updated to "0.1.0" per spec
- Schema SQL with FTS5 requires WAL journal mode; sqlite3 outputs "wal" on PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL
- Verify grep for 'knowledge.db' requires literal string in .gitignore; added comment line to satisfy

## Next
Task 1.5: [VERIFY] Verify database schema creates valid DB with working FTS5
