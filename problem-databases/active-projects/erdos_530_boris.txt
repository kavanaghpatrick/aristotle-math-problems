# Erdős Problem #530 - Maximal Sidon Subsets

Solve this open problem.

## Problem Statement

Let ℓ(N) be maximal such that in any finite set A ⊂ ℝ of size N there exists a Sidon subset S of size ℓ(N).

A Sidon set is one where the only solutions to a+b=c+d are the trivial ones (where {a,b}={c,d}).

Determine the order of ℓ(N).

In particular, is it true that ℓ(N) ~ N^(1/2)?

## What You Need To Prove

Either:
1. Prove ℓ(N) ~ N^(1/2) (the conjecture), OR
2. Prove a different asymptotic bound, OR
3. Establish tight bounds on ℓ(N)

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #530, an open problem in additive combinatorics.
