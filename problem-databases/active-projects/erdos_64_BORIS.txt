# Erdős Problem #64 - Power of 2 Cycles

Solve this open problem. Reward: $1000

## Problem Statement

Does every finite graph with minimum degree at least 3 contain a cycle of length 2^k for some k ≥ 2?

In other words: If G is a finite simple graph where every vertex has degree ≥ 3, must G contain a cycle of length 4, 8, 16, 32, or some other power of 2?

## What You Need To Prove

Either:
1. Prove YES: Every finite graph with min degree ≥ 3 contains a cycle of length 2^k for some k ≥ 2, OR
2. Prove NO: Construct a finite counterexample graph with min degree ≥ 3 that has no cycle of length 2^k for any k ≥ 2

## Known Progress

Liu and Montgomery (2020) proved that graphs with minimum degree exceeding some absolute constant C must contain a 2^k-cycle. The question remains: does min degree ≥ 3 suffice?

## Verification Examples

Graphs with min degree ≥ 3 that DO contain power-of-2 cycles:
- Complete graph K₄: min degree 3, contains C₄ (4-cycle) ✓
- Complete graph K₅: min degree 4, contains C₄ and C₈ ✓
- Petersen graph: min degree 3, contains cycles of various lengths

Small cycles to check:
- 4-cycle (2²): square
- 8-cycle (2³): octagon
- 16-cycle (2⁴)

Note: The problem asks for existence of ANY 2^k cycle, not all of them.
