# Erdős Problem #174 - Ramsey Set Characterization

Solve this open problem.

## Problem Statement

A finite set A ⊂ ℝⁿ is called Ramsey if, for any k ≥ 1, there exists some d = d(A,k) such that in any k-coloring of ℝᵈ there exists a monochromatic congruent copy of A.

### Known Results
- Every Ramsey set must be "spherical" (all points lie on a sphere)
- Rectangles, non-degenerate simplices, trapezoids, and regular polygons are Ramsey

### The Question
Characterize exactly which finite sets are Ramsey.

Graham conjectured: All spherical sets are Ramsey.
Leader-Russell-Walters proposed: Ramsey sets are exactly the "subtransitive" sets.

## What You Need To Prove

Either:
1. Prove Graham's conjecture (all spherical sets are Ramsey), OR
2. Prove the Leader-Russell-Walters characterization, OR
3. Find a counterexample to either conjecture

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #174, an open problem in Ramsey theory/combinatorial geometry.
