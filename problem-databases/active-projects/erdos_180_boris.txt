# Erdős Problem #180 - Extremal Numbers for Graph Families

Solve this open problem.

## Problem Statement

If F is a finite set of finite graphs, then ex(n; F) is the maximum number of edges a graph on n vertices can have without containing any subgraph from F.

Note: It is trivial that ex(n; F) ≤ ex(n; G) for every G ∈ F.

### The Conjecture

Is it true that for every finite family F of finite graphs, there exists some G ∈ F such that:

ex(n; G) ≪_F ex(n; F)?

In other words: Is the extremal number of the family always dominated (up to constants depending on F) by the extremal number of some single graph in the family?

## What You Need To Prove

Either:
1. Prove the conjecture holds for all finite families F, OR
2. Find a counterexample family F where no single G dominates

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #180, an open problem in extremal graph theory.
