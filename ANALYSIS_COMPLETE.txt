KEY FINDINGS:
=============

✓ PROVEN:
  - ν ≤ 4 ⟹ externals use ≤ 2 edges of X (5-packing argument)
  - Not all 3 external types can coexist for any X

✗ UNPROVEN:
  - 2 edges per X suffice for ALL triangles sharing edge with X
  - Bridges are covered by spine edges
  - 8-edge global cover exists
  - Independent edge selections per X compose

CRITICAL GAPS:
==============

Gap 1: S_X vs T_X Confusion (Line 143-144)
  Problem: Confuses externals (S_X) with all sharing triangles (T_X)
  Impact: Some triangles uncovered
  
Gap 2: Bridge Coordination Unproven (Line 155-171)
  Problem: Claims spine edges cover bridges without proof
  Impact: Bridges may not be covered
  
Gap 3: External Definition Ambiguity (Line 49-52)
  Problem: Unclear if M-elements must be separately covered
  Impact: May have coverage gaps
  
Gap 4: Missing Bridge Classification (Implicit)
  Problem: Doesn't distinguish bridges from externals
  Impact: Bridge argument doesn't apply to bridges
  
Gap 5: Main Theorem Sorry (Line 175-181)
  Problem: Bridge coordination proof hidden in sorry
  Impact: Entire τ ≤ 8 claim unproven

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
====================

Option A: Complete the Proof (2-8 hours)
  - Prove bridges_covered_by_adaptive_selection explicitly
  - Case analysis for each bridge type
  - Verify spine edge coordination
  Difficulty: Medium-Hard
  
Option B: Accept τ ≤ 12 (30 minutes)
  - Use proven slot139 result
  - Submit as complete proof
  Difficulty: None (already proven)
  
Option C: LP Fractional Relaxation (4-6 hours)
  - Use duality instead of combinatorial argument
  - Construct dual certificate
  Difficulty: Hard
  
Option D: Document as Open Problem (2 hours)
  - Submit τ ≤ 12 as proven result
  - Identify gaps in τ ≤ 8
  Difficulty: Easy

RECOMMENDATION:
================

Start with Option B (submit τ ≤ 12 proven result).
Then pursue Option A (bridge coordination) as separate research task.

FILES ANALYZED:
================

/Users/patrickkavanagh/math/submissions/nu4_final/slot335_adaptive_1sorry.lean
  - Main proof with single sorry
  - Contains all 5 gaps identified

/Users/patrickkavanagh/math/submissions/nu4_final/slot334_adaptive_cover.lean
  - Scaffolding with helper lemmas
  - bridges_covered_by_adaptive_selection is also sorry

/Users/patrickkavanagh/math/submissions/tracking.db
  - False lemmas database: patterns #6, #7, #17, #22, #27, #28
  - Confirms gaps via counterexamples

DATABASE VERIFICATION:
======================

False Lemma #7 (sunflower_cover_at_vertex_2edges):
  DISPROVES: 2 edges per shared vertex suffice
  
False Lemma #22 (bridge_externals_share_apex):
  DISPROVES: Externals of different M-elements share apex
  
False Lemma #27 (triangle_sym2_card_3):
  Shows: Careful about sym2 definitions with self-loops
  
False Lemma #28 (tau_S_union_X_le_2):
  DISPROVES: Spokes cover both S_e and bridges

All false lemmas support the gap analysis above.

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Review these 4 analysis documents
2. Decide on action path (A, B, C, or D)
3. If pursuing A or C: Create new proof file with explicit lemmas
4. If pursuing B: Use slot139 tau_le_12 proof
5. If pursuing D: Document gaps and submit as research finding

VERIFICATION:
==============

To formally verify the gaps, run Aristotle on:
  - Minimal counterexample for bridge coverage
  - Minimal counterexample for 2-edge insufficiency
  - Minimal counterexample for independent edge composition

This would provide formal proof that adaptive approach fails.
