Analyze `$ARGUMENTS` and recommend the optimal submission path.

## Recommendation

**State the gap bare. Submit INFORMAL.**

Every file should be converted to a bare-gap .txt sketch:
1. Extract the open conjecture statement
2. Write <=30 lines: OPEN GAP / English / Lean statement / Status
3. Submit via `/project:submit`

No FORMAL submissions. No proof scaffolding. No sorry-reduction. Let Aristotle find the path.
