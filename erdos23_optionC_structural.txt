# Erdős Problem #23 - Option C: Structural Proof

## THE PROBLEM

Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges.

## YOUR GOAL

Find a STRUCTURAL proof that works for infinitely many n, without relying on computation.

## APPROACH

Instead of checking all graphs computationally, prove structural lemmas about triangle-free graphs:

1. **Characterize the obstruction**: What makes a graph need many edge deletions?

2. **The C₅ blow-up structure**:
   - The worst case is blow-ups of C₅
   - Prove that graphs "far" from C₅ blow-ups need fewer deletions

3. **Decomposition approach**:
   - Decompose triangle-free graphs based on their structure
   - Handle each case separately

## POSSIBLE LEMMAS

```lean
-- Graphs with no 5-cycle need 0 edges removed (they're already bipartite)
lemma bipartite_of_no_odd_cycle (G : SimpleGraph V)
  (h : ∀ k, Odd k → ¬G.HasCycleOfLength k) : G.Colorable 2

-- Graphs with bounded odd girth have structured deletions
lemma deletion_bound_from_structure (G : SimpleGraph V)
  (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) (h_struct : SomeStructuralProperty G) :
  ∃ s, s.card ≤ f(n) ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

## You Decide
- Which structural properties to exploit
- How to characterize graphs needing many deletions
- The proof architecture

## Success Criteria
- Proves the bound for infinitely many n (not just fixed small cases)
- Uses structural reasoning, not brute force
- Zero sorries
