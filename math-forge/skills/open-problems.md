description: Query knowledge base for prior Aristotle results on an open problem
---

Query the knowledge base for what Aristotle has already tried on this problem.

## Steps

1. `mk find "<problem_id>"` — all prior findings
2. `mk failed "<problem keywords>"` — known dead ends
3. `mk context "<problem_id>"` — prior result files for auto-context

Use results to avoid repeating failed approaches. Do NOT propose proof strategies — let Aristotle find the path.
