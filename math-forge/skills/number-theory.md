description: NT-specific knowledge base queries for prior Aristotle results
---

Query the knowledge base for NT-specific prior results.

## Steps

1. `mk search "<nt keywords>"` — search all findings
2. `mk find "<problem_id>"` — specific problem history
3. `mk failed "<keywords>"` — failed approaches to avoid

Focus: what has Aristotle tried? What didn't work? What context files exist?
Do NOT recommend proof techniques — Aristotle chooses its own path.
