description: Surface prior Aristotle results and failed approaches for a problem
---

Surface what Aristotle has tried on this problem. NOT what WE should try.

## Steps

1. `mk context "<problem_id>"` — list all prior result .lean files
2. `mk failed "<keywords>"` — approaches that didn't work
3. `mk find "<problem_id>"` — all findings from prior attempts

The prior results inform Aristotle via `context_file_paths`, not via sketch content.
We don't choose strategies. Aristotle does.
