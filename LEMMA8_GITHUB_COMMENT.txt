### TL;DR: DO NOT ATTEMPT - Rating 2/5

## Key Findings

### 1. Is it TRUE?

**Locally: ✅ YES** - If triangle T contains both p and x_A, then s(p,x_A) ∈ T.sym2 (trivial)

**Globally: ❌ NO** - Depends on Lemma 3 (`private_external_contains_apex`), which is FALSE

### 2. Logical Gap: Lemma 3 Dependency

The lemma assumes:
> "All externals of A that contain private vertex p also contain fan apex x_A"

**This is FALSE** (proven Dec 29 by Pattern 6 counterexample):

```
At shared vertex v_ab between adjacent M-elements A and B:
  T_A = {v_ab, a_priv, x_A}  -- external of A
  T_B = {v_ab, b_priv, x_B}  -- external of B
  x_A ≠ x_B  (different fan apexes)
  T_A ∩ T_B = {v_ab}  (only shared vertex, not a common edge)
```

Different externals at the same shared vertex have different external vertices. The "fan apex" structure fails.

### 3. Can Aristotle Prove It?

**Probability: 60% (unsound proof)**

Aristotle might:
- Accept Lemma 3 without verification (just `sorry` it)
- Use proof-by-type-escape pattern (Pattern 14) to finalize
- Output "PROVEN" while hiding critical assumptions

**Risk**: High chance of unsound proof artifact.

### 4. Strategic Value: ZERO

Even if TRUE, the lemma:
- Covers only specific external types
- Doesn't reduce edge count below 12
- Depends on universal apex (blocked by Pattern 6)
- Ineffective for τ ≤ 8 proof

The universal apex strategy is **DEAD** (Pattern 6 proven it false Dec 29).

## The Dependency Chain (All Broken)

```
Lemma 8
  ↓ depends on
Lemma 3 (FALSE - Pattern 6 counterexample)
  ↓ depends on
fan_apex_exists (unproven)
  ↓ depends on
universal_apex_in_cycle4 (blocked at line 127)
  ↓ BLOCKED BY
Pattern 6: Different externals at v have different external vertices
```

**Verdict**: Every step of this dependency chain is either false or unproven.

## Three Core Problems

### Problem 1: False Prerequisite
Lemma 3 contradicts Pattern 6 (Dec 29, 2025). The fan apex doesn't exist for all externals of a single M-element.

### Problem 2: Underspecified Definition
"Private-type external" is not formally defined. What exactly does it mean?
- If: externals using ONLY private edges → still doesn't guarantee common apex
- If: any external containing p → some do, some don't

### Problem 3: Ineffective for Goal
Even if TRUE, doesn't achieve τ ≤ 8 without universal apex, which is BLOCKED by Pattern 6.

---

## Rating: 2/5

- ✅ Locally sound (trivial consequence)
- ❌ Globally unsound (false prerequisite)
- ❌ Strategically ineffective (doesn't advance τ ≤ 8)
- ⚠️ Proof risk (unsound artifact likely)
- ❌ Time investment (unproductive)

## Recommendation

### DO NOT ATTEMPT this lemma.

The universal apex strategy is fundamentally broken by Pattern 6. Until that's resolved (or a different approach found), this lemma is a dead end.

### Instead, focus on:
1. **Prove/disprove**: Do ALL externals of cycle_4 share a single external vertex? (slot185)
2. **Accept τ ≤ 12** as intermediate bound
3. **Explore alternative approaches** (not spoke-based)
