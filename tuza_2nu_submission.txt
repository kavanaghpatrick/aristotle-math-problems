# Tuza's Conjecture - The Full τ ≤ 2ν Bound

## THE PROBLEM (Open since 1981)

For any graph G:
  τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G)

Where:
- ν(G) = maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles (triangle packing number)
- τ(G) = minimum size of edge set hitting all triangles (triangle covering number)

## KNOWN RESULTS
- Trivial bound: τ(G) ≤ 3ν(G) (ALREADY PROVEN in prior submission)
- Conjecture: τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G) (THIS IS WHAT WE WANT)
- Known to hold for: planar graphs, sparse graphs, random graphs

## PRIOR SUBMISSION RESULT

Aristotle proved the WEAKER bound:
```lean
theorem triangleCoveringNumber_le_three_mul_trianglePackingNumber :
    triangleCoveringNumber G ≤ 3 * trianglePackingNumber G
```

This is NOT enough. We need the FULL conjecture.

## DEFINITIONS (verified correct)

```lean
def triangleEdges (t : Finset V) : Finset (Sym2 V) :=
  t.offDiag.image (fun x => Sym2.mk (x.1, x.2))

def IsEdgeDisjoint (T : Finset (Finset V)) : Prop :=
  (T : Set (Finset V)).PairwiseDisjoint triangleEdges

noncomputable def trianglePackingNumber : ℕ :=
  ((G.cliqueFinset 3).powerset.filter IsEdgeDisjoint).sup card

def IsTriangleCovering (S : Finset (Sym2 V)) : Prop :=
  (G.deleteEdges S).cliqueFinset 3 = ∅

noncomputable def triangleCoveringNumber : ℕ :=
  ((G.edgeFinset.powerset.filter (IsTriangleCovering G)).image card).min.getD G.edgeFinset.card
```

## TARGET THEOREM

```lean
theorem Tuza_conjecture
  {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj] :
    triangleCoveringNumber G ≤ 2 * trianglePackingNumber G
```

## You Decide
- The proof technique
- Whether to use LP relaxation, structural decomposition, or other methods
- Which special cases to handle first

## Success Criteria
- Prove τ ≤ 2ν (NOT 3ν - that's already done)
- Zero sorries
- Compiles with Lean 4.24.0 + Mathlib
