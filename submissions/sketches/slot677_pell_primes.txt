Domain: NT

The Pell numbers P_n are defined by P_0=0, P_1=1, P_{n+2}=2P_{n+1}+P_n.
Conjecture: there are infinitely many n such that P_n is prime.
Known primes at indices: 2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 29, 41, 53, 59, 89, 97, ...

theorem infinite_pellNumber_primes : Infinite {n : ℕ | Prime (pellNumber n)} := by sorry

Status: OPEN. Analogous to the open Fibonacci prime conjecture. No proof or disproof known.
