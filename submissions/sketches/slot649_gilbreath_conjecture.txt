Gilbreath's Conjecture: For the iterated absolute difference sequence of primes,
d^k(0) = 1 for all k > 0.

Define: d^0(n) = p_n (the nth prime, 0-indexed: p_0=2, p_1=3, p_2=5, ...)
       d^{k+1}(n) = |d^k(n+1) - d^k(n)|

The conjecture states d^k(0) = 1 for all k >= 1.

This has been verified computationally up to k ~ 10^13 but remains unproved.

PROOF STRATEGY — Multiple targets of decreasing ambition:

TARGET 1 (AMBITIOUS): Prove the full conjecture.
Approach: The key insight is that d^1(n) is the sequence of prime gaps, which starts
with 1 (|3-2|=1) and all subsequent terms are even (since p_{n+1}-p_n is even for n≥1).
At each subsequent level, taking absolute differences of a sequence starting with an odd
number followed by even numbers produces a sequence starting with an odd number.
By induction, d^k(0) is always odd. Combined with d^k(0) ≤ d^{k-1}(0) + d^{k-1}(1)
and monotonicity-type bounds, one can try to show d^k(0) = 1.

More precisely: d^1 = (1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, ...). The leading 1 followed by
even numbers means d^2(0) = |d^1(1) - d^1(0)| = |2-1| = 1. And this pattern propagates.

TARGET 2 (MODERATE): Prove d^k(0) is always odd for k >= 1.
Proof: d^1(0) = |p_1 - p_0| = 1 (odd). For k >= 1, d^k starts with an odd value
followed by even values (since prime gaps are even for p_n >= 3). The absolute
difference of an odd and even number is odd. So d^{k+1}(0) = |d^k(1) - d^k(0)|
where d^k(0) is odd and d^k(1) is even (by a sub-induction on the parity pattern).

TARGET 3 (ACHIEVABLE): Prove d^k(0) = 1 for specific small k values.
- d^1(0) = |p_1 - p_0| = |3-2| = 1
- d^2(0) = |d^1(1) - d^1(0)| = ||p_2-p_1| - |p_1-p_0|| = ||5-3| - |3-2|| = |2-1| = 1
- Similarly for k = 3,4,5,...

These can be proved by unfolding the definition and computing with specific prime values.
Use Nat.nth_prime facts: Nat.nth Nat.Prime 0 = 2, Nat.nth Nat.Prime 1 = 3, etc.

TARGET 4: Prove structural lemmas about the difference operator:
- d^k is always non-negative (it's defined via natAbs)
- If d^k starts with 1 followed by even numbers, then d^{k+1}(0) = 1
- The parity pattern: d^k(0) is odd for k >= 1

Please prove as many of these targets as possible, prioritizing Target 2 (odd parity)
and Target 3 (specific small cases), then attempt Target 1 if time permits.
