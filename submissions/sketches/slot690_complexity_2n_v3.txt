OPEN GAP: Integer Complexity of Powers of 2

Domain: nt

The integer complexity of 2^n equals 2n. Here complexity(n) is the minimum number of 1's needed to represent n using addition and multiplication.

  integerComplexity (2 ^ n) = 2 * n := by sorry

Status: OPEN. Known: complexity(2^n) ≤ 2n (trivial). Lower bound is open. Prior slot reduced to weight subadditivity conjectures.
