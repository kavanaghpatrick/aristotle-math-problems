OPEN GAP: First Hardy-Littlewood conjecture (prime k-tuples)
Source: formal-conjectures/FormalConjectures/Wikipedia/HardyLittlewood.lean
Domain: NT

For admissible prime constellations (p, p+2m_1, ..., p+2m_k), the counting function
π_P(n) is asymptotic to C_P · ∫_2^n dt/log^{k+1}(t), where C_P is an explicit constant
involving residue class counts modulo each prime.

Status: OPEN. Implies twin prime conjecture (k=1). Incompatible with second HL conjecture (Richards 1974).
