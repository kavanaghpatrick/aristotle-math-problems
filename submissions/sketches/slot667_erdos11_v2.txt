Erdős Problem 11: Every odd n > 1 = squarefree + power of 2 — CONTINUATION

The attached 103-line context has:
1. check_erdos_11: computable verification function (checks all 2^l up to log₂ n)
2. check_erdos_11_correct: soundness proof
3. check_erdos_11_range / erdos_11_bounded_of_check: range checking with proof
4. erdos_11_upto_1000: verified for n < 1000 by native_decide
5. IsWieferichPrime, erdos_candidates, HasNaturalDensity definitions

=== WHAT TO DO (building on context) ===

GOAL 1: Push bounded verification much higher.
The context verifies n < 1000. Push to:
- erdos_11_upto_10000: native_decide for n < 10000
- erdos_11_upto_100000: native_decide for n < 100000
(The check_erdos_11_range function is already correct; just apply to larger bounds.)

GOAL 2: Prove the "almost all" density result.
For each l, n - 2^l is squarefree with density 6/π² (the squarefree density).
With log₂(n) candidates, the density of failures is at most (1 - 6/π²)^{log₂ n} → 0.

More precisely:
- Define FailSet := {n odd | n > 1 ∧ ∀ l ≤ log₂ n, ¬Squarefree (n - 2^l)}
- The density of FailSet is 0.

Approach: For fixed prime p, the set {n : p² | (n - 2^l) for ALL l ∈ [0, log₂ n]} has density 0 (since 2 has order p²-p in (ℤ/p²ℤ)*, and the residues 2^l mod p² are well-distributed).

Actually, for each p: the number of l ∈ [0, L] with n ≡ 2^l mod p² is at most ⌈L/ord_{p²}(2)⌉ + 1.
So at most L/p fraction of candidates n - 2^l are divisible by p² (roughly).

GOAL 3: Prove the Granville-Soundararajan conditional.
If the conjecture holds → Wieferich primes are infinite.

PROOF SKETCH for Granville-Soundararajan:
Assume only finitely many Wieferich primes p₁,...,pₖ.
For large odd n, write n = s + 2^l with s squarefree (by hypothesis).
Consider n = 2^l + s. For each non-Wieferich prime p > 2:
  ord_p²(2) > p-1, so 2^l mod p² takes at most ⌈L/(p-1+1)⌉ ≤ L/p values.
But for Wieferich primes: 2^{p-1} ≡ 1 mod p², so ord_{p²}(2) | p(p-1), and
the 2^l values mod p² cycle with period dividing p(p-1).

The contradiction comes from: if all primes are non-Wieferich, then the squarefree
part s = n - 2^l has very restricted p²-free structure, which is impossible for
sufficiently large n because the "available" candidates n - 2^l are too constrained.

GOAL 4: Verify the two-powers-of-2 variant.
erdos_11_two_pow: ∀ odd n > 1, ∃ k l m, Squarefree k ∧ n = k + 2^l + 2^m

This is easier because we have log₂(n)² candidates instead of log₂(n).

PROOF TARGETS (prioritized):
1. erdos_11_upto_10000 and erdos_11_upto_100000 (bounded verification)
2. HasNaturalDensity FailSet 0 (density result)
3. granville_soundararajan conditional
4. erdos_11_two_pow (variant with two powers of 2)
