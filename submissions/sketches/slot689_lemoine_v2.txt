OPEN GAP: Lemoine's Conjecture (Levy's Conjecture)
Source: formal-conjectures
Domain: nt

Every odd integer n >= 7 can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a prime: n = p + 2q where p, q are prime.

  ∃ p q : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q ∧ n = p + 2 * q := by sorry

Status: OPEN. Verified for n ≤ 10^9. Implies Goldbach for even numbers ≤ 2n. Prior slot verified n≤1000 in Lean.
