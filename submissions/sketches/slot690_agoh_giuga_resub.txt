OPEN GAP: Agoh-Giuga conjecture
Source: Open problem in number theory
Domain: nt

A composite n is a Giuga number if for every prime p dividing n, p divides (n/p - 1). The conjecture states no Giuga number exists, equivalently: n is prime iff sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^{n-1} ≡ -1 (mod n).

Status: OPEN. Known that any Giuga number has ≥9 prime factors and exceeds 10^6. The attached context proves both bounds. Close the gap.
