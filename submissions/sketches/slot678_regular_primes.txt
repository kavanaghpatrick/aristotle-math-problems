Domain: NT

A prime p is regular if p does not divide the class number of Q(zeta_p).
Equivalently, p does not divide any numerator of Bernoulli numbers B_2,...,B_{p-3}.
Conjecture: the set of regular primes is infinite.

Status: OPEN. Heuristically ~61% of primes are regular (e^{-1/2}). Verified computationally to large bounds. No proof known.
