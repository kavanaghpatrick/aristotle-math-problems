Sierpinski Conjecture (5/n): Resolve the HARD CASE — all prime factors ≡ 1 mod 4

CONTEXT: The attached 1316-line context file contains a COMPLETE reduction framework:
- Full conjecture reduced to n ≡ 1 mod 60, i.e., n = 60q+1
- SierpinskiHardCase defined: all prime factors of (60q+1)(12q+1) are ≡ 1 mod 4
- solvable_of_not_hard: if ANY factor ≡ 3 mod 4, decomposition exists
- sierpinski_general_modular_reduction: systematic elimination via primes ≡ 3 mod 4
- Coverage using primes 7 through 199
- Verified for ALL n < 1,000,000

THE REMAINING OPEN QUESTION:
Can we prove that for ALL q > 0, at least one prime factor of (60q+1)(12q+1) is ≡ 3 mod 4?
Equivalently: does every n ≡ 1 mod 60 have 5/n decomposable as sum of 3 unit fractions?

APPROACHES TO TRY:

1. DENSITY/SIEVING ARGUMENT:
   By CRT, the density of q NOT covered by the first k primes ≡ 3 mod 4 is
   ∏_{p ≡ 3 mod 4, p ≤ P} (1 - 2/p) which → 0 as P → ∞ (since ∑ 1/p diverges over primes ≡ 3 mod 4 by Dirichlet).
   This proves density 1 coverage but not ALL q. Formalize this density argument.

2. ALTERNATIVE DECOMPOSITION for the hard case:
   Instead of 5/n = 1/(12q+1) + 4/((60q+1)(12q+1)), try:
   - 5/(60q+1) = 1/(12q+1) + ... (as before) — fails for hard case
   - 5/(60q+1) = 1/(15q+1) + ... compute remainder
   - 5/(60q+1) = 2/(60q+1) + 3/(60q+1), then decompose each separately
   - For n = 60q+1: try x = 20q+1, then 5/n - 1/(20q+1) = (100q+5-60q-1)/(n(20q+1)) = (40q+4)/(n(20q+1)) = 4(10q+1)/(n(20q+1))
     If gcd(10q+1, 20q+1) has factor ≡ 3 mod 4, done.
   - Try x = 15q+1, then 5/n - 1/(15q+1) = (75q+5-60q-1)/(n(15q+1)) = (15q+4)/(n(15q+1))
   - Try x = 24q+1 (since 5*24 = 120 = 2*60), then 5/(60q+1) - 1/(24q+1) = ...

3. COMBINE MULTIPLE FIRST-FRACTION CHOICES:
   The hard case for x = 12q+1 requires all factors of (60q+1)(12q+1) ≡ 1 mod 4.
   But we can also try x = 20q+1 → different product to factor.
   If BOTH products have all factors ≡ 1 mod 4, that's an extremely restrictive condition.
   Prove that this intersection is empty (or finite).

4. EXTEND BOUNDED VERIFICATION:
   Push from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 if possible.

5. PROVE THE UNCONDITIONAL THEOREM for specific infinite families:
   - q ≡ 0 mod 3 → already covered (3 | 12q+1 gives factor 3 ≡ 3 mod 4) ✓
   - q ≡ 1 mod 3 → sierpinski_mod_3_1_reduction (alternative decomposition) ✓
   - q ≡ 2 mod 3 → need to check: 12q+1 ≡ 12·2+1 = 25 ≡ 1 mod 4. 60q+1 ≡ 121 ≡ 1 mod 4.
     But 25 = 5², 121 = 11². Product = 5²·11² has factor 11 ≡ 3 mod 4!
     Wait — 11 ≡ 3 mod 4 ✓. So q ≡ 2 mod 3 always has 11 | (60q+1) when q ≡ 2 mod 11?
     No, more carefully: for GENERAL q ≡ 2 mod 3, (12q+1)(60q+1) may or may not have factor ≡ 3 mod 4.
     Need to sub-divide further.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Extend coverage using more primes and alternative first-fraction choices
2. Prove density result: the set of uncovered q has density 0
3. Try to prove a COMPLETE theorem for all q (full resolution)
4. If not full resolution, characterize exactly what's left
