OPEN GAP: Artin's conjecture on primitive roots (part i)

If a is not a perfect square and a ≠ -1, then the set of primes p for which a is a
primitive root mod p has positive density inside the primes. In particular, S(a) is infinite.

Status: OPEN. Proved conditionally on GRH by Hooley (1967). Unconditional proof unknown.
