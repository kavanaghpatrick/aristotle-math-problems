OPEN GAP: Gilbreath's Conjecture
Source: formal-conjectures
Domain: nt

The first element of every row of iterated absolute differences of the prime sequence equals 1. That is, if d^0(n) = p_{n+1} (the (n+1)-th prime) and d^{k+1}(n) = |d^k(n+1) - d^k(n)|, then d^k(0) = 1 for all k >= 1.

Status: OPEN. Verified computationally for k up to ~10^13. No proof known. Prior slot verified k≤10 in Lean.
