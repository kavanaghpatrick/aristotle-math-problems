# Pach Coloring Conjecture - Boris Pattern Submission

## Goal
Prove or characterize for which positive integers n there exists an n-satisfactory
coloring of the positive integers.

An n-satisfactory coloring is a function c: ℤ⁺ → {1,2,...,n} such that for every
positive integer a, the values c(a), c(2a), c(3a), ..., c(na) are all distinct.

## You Decide
- Which proof strategy to use
- Which lemmas to create
- How to structure the formalization
- Which intermediate theorems to prove

## Mathematical Background

### The Problem
For which n does there exist a coloring c: ℤ⁺ → {1,2,...,n} such that for every a ∈ ℤ⁺,
the n numbers a, 2a, 3a, ..., na all receive different colors?

### Known Results (Caicedo, Chartier, Pach 2021)

**Sufficient conditions for n-satisfactory coloring to exist:**
- n + 1 is prime
- 2n + 1 is prime
- n = p² - p for some prime p

**Characterization:**
An n-satisfactory coloring exists if and only if there is an abelian group operation ⊕
on {1,2,...,n} compatible with multiplication: whenever i, j, and ij are all in {1,...,n},
then ij = i ⊕ j.

**Equivalence:**
There is an n-satisfactory coloring of ℤ⁺ if and only if there is such a coloring
of Kₙ (the set of n-smooth numbers).

**Small cases verified:**
- n = 2: ✅ (color by parity of 2-adic valuation)
- n = 3: ✅ (n+1 = 4 is not prime, but 2n+1 = 7 is prime)
- n = 4: ✅ (n+1 = 5 is prime)
- n = 5: ✅ (2n+1 = 11 is prime)
- n = 6: ✅ (n+1 = 7 is prime)

**Connection to tilings:**
The existence question is equivalent to a problem about tilings, providing a
geometric characterization of multiplicative colorings.

### Open Cases
The first open case is n = 10 (where n+1=11 prime works) but the general
characterization for arbitrary n is unknown.

## Constraint
Must establish a complete characterization or prove existence/non-existence
for the general case.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Formal proof in Lean 4
- ✅ Zero sorries
- ✅ Compiles without errors
- ✅ Either: proves general characterization, OR proves specific open cases
