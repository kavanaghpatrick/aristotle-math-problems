# Tuza's Conjecture

**Statement**: For any graph G, τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G)

Where:
- ν(G) = maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in G
- τ(G) = minimum number of edges to delete to make G triangle-free

**Status**: Open since 1981. Best known bound is τ ≤ 1.98ν.

**Tight examples**: Block graphs with K₄ and K₅ blocks achieve τ = 2ν.

Prove it.
