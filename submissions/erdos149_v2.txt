# Erdős Problem #149 - Strong Chromatic Index

## Goal
Prove the Erdős-Nešetřil conjecture: χ'_s(G) ≤ (5/4)Δ² where:
- χ'_s(G) = strong chromatic index (chromatic number of the square of the line graph)
- Δ = maximum degree of G

## Context: What You Already Proved (from 7ff9972c)

### Definitions Created
- `SimpleGraph.square` - graph with edges between vertices at distance 1 or 2
- `SimpleGraph.strongChromaticIndex` - χ'_s(G) := χ(L(G)²)

### Theorems Proved
1. `erdos_149_C5` - Conjecture holds for the 5-cycle
2. `lineGraph_maxDegree_le_of_maxDegree_le_two` - Δ ≤ 2 implies Δ(L(G)) ≤ 2
3. `maxDegree_square_le_sq_maxDegree` - Δ(G²) ≤ Δ(G)²
4. `chromaticNumber_le_maxDegree_succ` - χ(G) ≤ Δ + 1 (greedy coloring)
5. `strongChromaticIndex_eq_zero_of_maxDegree_eq_zero` - Δ = 0 ⟹ χ'_s = 0
6. `strongChromaticIndex_le_one_of_maxDegree_eq_one` - Δ = 1 ⟹ χ'_s ≤ 1
7. `erdos_149_delta_le_2` - Δ ≤ 2 ⟹ χ'_s ≤ (5/4)Δ²

### Holes Remaining
- Two `exact?` holes in `maxDegree_square_le_sq_maxDegree` and `erdos_149_delta_le_2`

## What Remains for Full Conjecture

The Δ ≤ 2 case is done. For general Δ, the approaches are:

### Approach 1: Induction on Δ
- Base cases (Δ = 0, 1, 2) are done
- Need inductive step: reduce to smaller Δ cases

### Approach 2: Direct Bound via Structure
- Use that L(G)² has Δ ≤ 2Δ(G) - 2 (for Δ ≥ 2)
- Then Δ(L(G)²) ≤ (2Δ - 2)² = 4Δ² - 8Δ + 4
- Apply χ ≤ Δ + 1 to get χ'_s ≤ 4Δ² - 8Δ + 5
- This is WORSE than (5/4)Δ², so more structure needed

### Approach 3: Special Graph Classes
- The conjecture is known for:
  - Bipartite graphs
  - Subcubic graphs (Δ ≤ 3)
  - Chordal graphs
- Reduce general case to these

## Key Insight
For Δ ≥ 3, the bound (5/4)Δ² is tight for the graph C5^(Δ/2) (blow-up of C5).
This suggests the extremal structure is C5-related, similar to Erdős #23!
