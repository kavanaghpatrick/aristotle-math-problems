# Tuza's Conjecture: ν=4 Case

## Goal
Prove that for any graph G with exactly 4 edge-disjoint triangles (ν=4), the minimum number of edges needed to hit all triangles is at most 8 (τ ≤ 8).

## Definitions
- Triangle packing number ν(G): maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles
- Triangle covering number τ(G): minimum edges to hit all triangles

## The Conjecture
τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G) for all graphs G.

## Target
Prove: ν(G) = 4 implies τ(G) ≤ 8.
