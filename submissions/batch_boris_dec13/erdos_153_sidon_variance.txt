# Erdős Problem #153: Sidon Set Sumset Gap Variance

## Problem Statement

Let A be a finite Sidon set and A+A = {s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₜ}. Is it true that

(1/t) ∑_{i=1}^{t-1} (s_{i+1} - s_i)² → ∞

as |A| → ∞?

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #153, an open problem about the distribution of gaps in sumsets of Sidon sets.

A Sidon set is a set of natural numbers such that all pairwise sums are distinct.

The sumset A+A = {a+b : a,b ∈ A} can be written in increasing order as s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₜ.

The question asks whether the average squared gap between consecutive elements of A+A tends to infinity as the Sidon set grows.

## Goal

Prove or disprove: For finite Sidon sets A, the quantity (1/t)∑(s_{i+1} - s_i)² is unbounded as |A| → ∞.
