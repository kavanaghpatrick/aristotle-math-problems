# Erdős Problem #593: Hypergraph Characterization ($500 Prize)

## Problem Statement

Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear in every 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number > ℵ₀.

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #593, an open problem in infinite combinatorics with a $500 prize.

A 3-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph where every edge contains exactly 3 vertices.

The chromatic number of a hypergraph is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the vertices so that no edge is monochromatic.

ℵ₀ (aleph-null) is the cardinality of the natural numbers, so chromatic number > ℵ₀ means uncountably many colours are required.

For ordinary graphs (2-uniform hypergraphs), this problem is solved: any graph with chromatic number ≥ ℵ₁ must contain all finite bipartite graphs but need not contain any fixed odd cycle.

## Goal

Characterize the family of finite 3-uniform hypergraphs H such that H appears as a subhypergraph in every 3-uniform hypergraph with uncountable chromatic number.
