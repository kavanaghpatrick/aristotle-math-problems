# Erdős Problem #23: Triangle-Free Bipartite

## Problem Statement

Can every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges?

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #23, an open problem in extremal graph theory.

A graph is triangle-free if it contains no cycle of length 3.
A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be partitioned into two sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other.

## Goal

Prove or disprove: For all positive integers n, every triangle-free graph G on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by removing at most n² edges.
