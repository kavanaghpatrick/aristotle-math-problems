# Erdős Problem #167: Triangle Removal Bound

## Problem Statement

If G is a graph with at most k edge-disjoint triangles, can G be made triangle-free by removing at most 2k edges?

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #167, an open problem relating triangle packing to triangle covering.

Two triangles are edge-disjoint if they share no edges.

The question asks whether the minimum number of edges needed to destroy all triangles (edge cover number) is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles (edge packing number).

## Goal

Prove or disprove: For every graph G, if G contains at most k pairwise edge-disjoint triangles, then there exists a set of at most 2k edges whose removal makes G triangle-free.
