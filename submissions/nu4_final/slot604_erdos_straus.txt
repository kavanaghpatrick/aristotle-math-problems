ERDŐS–STRAUS CONJECTURE: STRUCTURAL LEMMAS AND BOUNDED VERIFICATION

OPEN PROBLEM (since 1948): For every integer n ≥ 2, the equation
  4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z
has a solution in positive integers x, y, z.

This is one of the most famous unsolved problems in number theory. It has been
verified computationally for all n up to 10^14. The conjecture reduces to
proving it for prime n (if it holds for p, it holds for all multiples of p
since 4/(kp) = 1/(kx) + 1/(ky) + 1/(kz)).

GOAL: Prove structural lemmas, residue class reductions, and bounded verification.
Any subset of the following is valuable as a FIRST formalization.

STRATEGY 1: RESIDUE CLASS RESOLUTION
For n ≡ 0 (mod 4): trivial. 4/n = 1/(n/4) + 1/(n/4) + 1/(n/2). Wait, that's
only if n/4 is an integer. More carefully: 4/(4k) = 1/k, not a 3-fraction sum.
Actually we need 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z, so for n = 4k: 1/k = 1/x+1/y+1/z.
This is harder, not easier. Better approach:

For n ≡ 0 (mod 2): 4/n = 2/(n/2). We need 2/m = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z where m = n/2.
  If m is even: 2/m = 1/(m/2) + 1/(m/2) ... no, need to think differently.

KEY PARAMETRIC FAMILIES (proven in literature):
1. n ≡ 0 (mod 4): 4/n = 1/(n/4) + 1/(n/2) + 1/(n/4) — wait this sums to 4/n only
   if the fractions add correctly. Let me be precise.
   4/(4k) = 1/k. We need 1/k = 1/x+1/y+1/z. Take x=k+1, then 1/k - 1/(k+1) = 1/(k(k+1)).
   So 1/k = 1/(k+1) + 1/(k(k+1)/2) + 1/(k(k+1)/2) when k(k+1) is even (always true).
   Actually: 1/k = 1/(k+1) + 1/(k(k+1)). That's only 2 fractions. Add z = ∞? No.
   The standard identity: 4/n = 1/⌈n/4⌉ + (4⌈n/4⌉ - n)/(n⌈n/4⌉) decomposed further.

Actually, the cleanest approach uses known parametric solutions:

PARAMETRIC SOLUTION 1: If n ≡ 2 (mod 4), write n = 4k+2:
  4/(4k+2) = 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(2k+1)) + 1/((k+1)(2k+1))
  Check: 1/(k+1) + 2/((k+1)(2k+1)) = 1/(k+1) * (1 + 2/(2k+1)) = 1/(k+1) * (2k+3)/(2k+1)
  = (2k+3)/((k+1)(2k+1)). Is this 4/(4k+2) = 2/(2k+1)? We need (2k+3)/((k+1)(2k+1)) = 2/(2k+1).
  That gives 2k+3 = 2(k+1) = 2k+2. False. Let me redo.

  Standard: 4/(4k+2) = 2/(2k+1). Take 2/(2k+1) = 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(2k+1)).
  Check: 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(2k+1)) = (2k+1+1)/((k+1)(2k+1)) = (2k+2)/((k+1)(2k+1))
  = 2(k+1)/((k+1)(2k+1)) = 2/(2k+1). ✓
  So 4/(4k+2) = 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(2k+1)) + 0. But we need 3 positive terms.
  Split: 1/((k+1)(2k+1)) into two: take a = 2(k+1)(2k+1), then 1/a + 1/a = 1/((k+1)(2k+1)).
  So 4/(4k+2) = 1/(k+1) + 1/(2(k+1)(2k+1)) + 1/(2(k+1)(2k+1)).
  This works when (k+1)(2k+1) is ... always works since x,y,z > 0.

PARAMETRIC SOLUTION 2: If n ≡ 3 (mod 4), write n = 4k+3:
  4/(4k+3) = 1/(k+1) + (4k+4-4k-3)/((k+1)(4k+3)) = 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(4k+3)).
  Same trick: 4/(4k+3) = 1/(k+1) + 1/(2(k+1)(4k+3)) + 1/(2(k+1)(4k+3)).
  Check: 1/(k+1) + 2/(2(k+1)(4k+3)) = 1/(k+1)(1 + 1/(4k+3)) = (4k+4)/((k+1)(4k+3))
  = 4/(4k+3). ✓ This works for ALL n ≡ 3 (mod 4)!

PARAMETRIC SOLUTION 3: n ≡ 1 (mod 4), write n = 4k+1:
  4/(4k+1) = 1/(k+1) + (4k+4-4k-1)/((k+1)(4k+1)) = 1/(k+1) + 3/((k+1)(4k+1)).
  Now 3/((k+1)(4k+1)): this is 1/x + 1/y where xy/3 = (k+1)(4k+1)/3.
  This works when 3 | (k+1)(4k+1), i.e., when 3 | (k+1) or 3 | (4k+1).
  3 | (k+1) ↔ k ≡ 2 (mod 3) ↔ n = 4k+1 ≡ 9 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Wait: 4*2+1 = 9.
  3 | (4k+1) ↔ k ≡ 2 (mod 3) again? 4k+1 ≡ k+1 (mod 3). So 3|(4k+1) ↔ k ≡ 2 (mod 3).
  Actually 3|(k+1) ↔ k ≡ 2 (mod 3). And 3|(4k+1) ↔ 4k ≡ -1 ↔ k ≡ 2 (mod 3).
  So both conditions give k ≡ 2 (mod 3), i.e., n ≡ 0 (mod 3).
  For n ≡ 1 (mod 12) (k ≡ 0 mod 3): different decomposition needed.
  For n ≡ 5 (mod 12) (k ≡ 1 mod 3): also different.

  For n ≡ 1 (mod 4) AND 3|n (n ≡ 9 mod 12):
  4/(4k+1) = 1/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(4k+1)/3) + 1/((k+1)(4k+1)/3 * something).
  Need to work out carefully.

So the problem REDUCES to: n ≡ 1 (mod 12) prime, and n ≡ 5 (mod 12) prime.
These are the hard cases. For these, specific decompositions exist for many
sub-residue classes modulo 24, 120, etc.

WHAT TO FORMALIZE:
1. DEFINITION: ErdosStraus n ↔ ∃ x y z : ℕ+, 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z
   (Working in ℚ or using the clearing-denominators form: 4xyz = n(yz + xz + xy))

2. REDUCTION TO PRIMES: ErdosStraus n for all n ≥ 2 ↔ ErdosStraus p for all primes p ≥ 2.

3. PARAMETRIC SOLUTIONS:
   - n ≡ 0 (mod 2): explicit decomposition
   - n ≡ 3 (mod 4): explicit decomposition (1/(k+1) + 1/(2(k+1)(4k+3)) + ...)
   - n ≡ 0 (mod 3): explicit decomposition
   Combined: suffices to prove for n ≡ 1 (mod 12) prime.

4. BOUNDED VERIFICATION:
   - ErdosStraus holds for all n ≤ 10,000 via native_decide
   - Check: for each n, try all x ≤ n, compute 4/n - 1/x = (4x-n)/(nx),
     then check if (4x-n)/(nx) is a sum of two unit fractions.

5. ADDITIONAL RESIDUE CLASSES: For n ≡ 1 (mod 12):
   - If n ≡ 1 (mod 5): 4/n = 1/⌈n/4⌉ + ... (specific identity)
   - If n ≡ 1 (mod 7): similar
   These resolve more sub-classes, showing ErdosStraus for all n ≡ 1 (mod 12)
   except possibly n ≡ 1 (mod 420) prime.

6. INTEGER FORM (clearing denominators): 4/n = 1/x+1/y+1/z ↔ 4xyz = n(yz+xz+xy).
   This avoids fractions entirely. Work in ℕ.

The conjecture is still OPEN but the structural reductions and bounded cases
constitute the first-ever formalization of Erdős–Straus partial results.
These lemmas have never been formalized in any proof assistant.
