OPEN PROBLEM: Erdős 364 — No three consecutive powerful numbers
Source: https://www.erdosproblems.com/364
Status: Open since 1976. The weaker result (no four consecutive) is proven.

THEOREM STATEMENT:
There do not exist natural numbers n such that n, n+1, and n+2 are all powerful
(i.e., every prime factor appears with exponent ≥ 2).

KNOWN RESULTS:
- No four consecutive powerful numbers (proven in the file via mod 4 argument):
  Among n, n+1, n+2, n+3, one is ≡ 2 (mod 4), which can't be powerful.
- Erdős conjectured the stronger gap result: n_{k+2} - n_k > n_k^c for some c > 0.
- Consecutive powerful PAIRS exist: (8,9), (288,289), (675,676), ...
  8 = 2³, 9 = 3². 288 = 2⁵·3², 289 = 17².

PROOF STRATEGY — MODULAR CONSTRAINTS:
Step 1: Force n ≡ 3 (mod 4).
Among n, n+1, n+2: one is ≡ 2 (mod 4). If n ≡ 0: n+2 ≡ 2, not powerful.
If n ≡ 1: n+1 ≡ 2, not powerful. If n ≡ 2: n ≡ 2, not powerful.
Only n ≡ 3 (mod 4) allows all three to potentially be powerful:
  n ≡ 3 (mod 4): odd, could be powerful
  n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 4): 4|n+1, need v₂(n+1) ≥ 2 ✓
  n+2 ≡ 1 (mod 4): odd, could be powerful

Step 2: Analyze mod 9.
One of n, n+1, n+2 is divisible by 3. For it to be powerful, 9 must divide it.
Case A: 3|n. Then 9|n (powerful). n ≡ 0 (mod 9) and n ≡ 3 (mod 4).
  By CRT: n ≡ 27 (mod 36).
  Then n+1 ≡ 28 (mod 36) ≡ 0 (mod 4), 3∤(n+1). ✓
  And n+2 ≡ 29 (mod 36) ≡ 1 (mod 4), 3∤(n+2). ✓

Case B: 3|n+1. Then 9|n+1. n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 9), n ≡ 3 (mod 4).
  n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 36). n ≡ 35 (mod 36). n+2 ≡ 1 (mod 36). ✓

Case C: 3|n+2. Then 9|n+2. n+2 ≡ 0 (mod 9), n ≡ 3 (mod 4).
  n+2 ≡ 9 (mod 36). n ≡ 7 (mod 36). n+1 ≡ 8 (mod 36). ✓

Step 3: Analyze mod 25.
One of n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 is divisible by 5. Among THREE consecutive, at most
one is divisible by 5. If 5|n or 5|n+1 or 5|n+2, then 25 must divide that one.

Case A (n ≡ 27 mod 36):
  Sub-case 5|n: 25|n, so n ≡ 0 (mod 25) and n ≡ 27 (mod 36).
    CRT: n mod 900. Working modulo 900.
  Sub-case 5|n+1: 25|n+1, n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 25), n ≡ 24 (mod 25), n ≡ 27 (mod 36).
    CRT gives specific residue mod 900.
  Sub-case 5|n+2: 25|n+2, similar.
  Sub-case 5∤n, 5∤n+1, 5∤n+2: all three avoid 5. This is possible since
    consecutive triples can avoid 5 (e.g., 8,9,10 — oops, 10 is divisible by 5).
    Actually: among 3 consecutive, at most one is divisible by 5. And it's possible
    for none to be divisible by 5.

Step 4: Combine constraints modulo lcm(4, 9, 25) = 900.
For each of the 3 cases (A, B, C from mod 9) × subcases from mod 25,
we get specific residues mod 900. Check each: can n, n+1, n+2 all be powerful?

For the powerful constraint on the odd numbers (n and n+2 when n ≡ 3 mod 4):
Every prime factor must appear with exponent ≥ 2. The smallest powerful numbers
that avoid 2 and 3 are: 1, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, ...

BOUNDED APPROACH (pragmatic for Aristotle):
Prove that there is no triple of consecutive powerful numbers below 10^6.
This can be done computationally:
1. Enumerate powerful numbers below 10^6 (there are ~O(√N) of them ≈ 1000).
2. Check consecutive pairs and triples.
The fact: powerful(n) ∧ powerful(n+1) ∧ powerful(n+2) = false for all n < 10^6.

For Lean formalization: use native_decide or decide on a bounded range.
Alternatively, verify computationally and encode the result.

DEEPER APPROACH (speculative):
Consider n, n+1, n+2 with n ≡ 3 (mod 4), all powerful.
n = a²b (powerful representation: n = a²b where b is squarefree)
n+2 = c²d (similarly)
n+1 = 4m where m is a powerful number (since 4|n+1 and n+1 powerful)

The equation c²d - a²b = 2 is a Diophantine constraint.
Combined with 4m = a²b + 1 (or equivalently m = (a²b+1)/4).

This connects to the theory of powerful number gaps. The gap between consecutive
powerful numbers n_k and n_{k+1} satisfies n_{k+1} - n_k → ∞, but the question
is whether it can be as small as 1 for three in a row.

REDIRECT FOR ARISTOTLE:
Target the bounded case first: prove no three consecutive powerful numbers
exist below 10^4 or 10^5. If that works, try the full modular argument.

For the full proof, the key would be to show that for n ≡ 3 (mod 4),
the constraints from mod 9, mod 25, mod 49 (all prime squares) leave no
valid residue class where all three can simultaneously be powerful.
