MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT:
There exists a finite nonabelian group that is a Leinster group.

PROOF:
The witness is G = S₃ × C₅, the direct product of the symmetric group on 3
elements with the cyclic group of order 5. This group has order 6 × 5 = 30.

In Lean 4, we can represent this as:
  G := Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) × ZMod 5

Step 1: G is nonabelian.
S₃ is nonabelian. For example, let σ = (1 2) and τ = (1 3) in S₃.
Then σ ∘ τ = (1 3 2) ≠ (1 2 3) = τ ∘ σ.
Since S₃ embeds into G via the first factor, G is also nonabelian.

Step 2: Enumerate normal subgroups of G = S₃ × C₅.
Since gcd(|S₃|, |C₅|) = gcd(6, 5) = 1, by Goursat's lemma for groups of
coprime order, every normal subgroup of S₃ × C₅ is of the form N × M where
N is a normal subgroup of S₃ and M is a normal subgroup of C₅.

Normal subgroups of S₃: {e} (order 1), A₃ (order 3), S₃ (order 6)
Normal subgroups of C₅: {0} (order 1), C₅ (order 5)

All products N × M:
  {e} × {0}:  order 1 × 1  = 1
  {e} × C₅:   order 1 × 5  = 5
  A₃ × {0}:   order 3 × 1  = 3
  A₃ × C₅:    order 3 × 5  = 15
  S₃ × {0}:   order 6 × 1  = 6
  S₃ × C₅:    order 6 × 5  = 30

Step 3: Verify the Leinster condition.
Sum of orders of normal subgroups:
  1 + 5 + 3 + 15 + 6 + 30 = 60

Twice the group order:
  2 × 30 = 60

Since 60 = 60, G = S₃ × C₅ is a Leinster group.

Step 4: Conclude.
G = S₃ × C₅ is a nonabelian Leinster group, proving existence. QED.

LEAN 4 PROOF STRATEGY:
- Use `⟨Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) × ZMod 5, inferInstance, inferInstance, ⟨_, _⟩⟩` as the witness.
- For IsLeinster: enumerate normal subgroups and compute the sum. This may require
  establishing the Fintype instance for {H : Subgroup G // H.Normal} and then
  computing via native_decide or a chain of norm_num/decide lemmas.
- For nonabelian: provide specific elements that don't commute.
  Use Equiv.swap 0 1 and Equiv.swap 0 2 in Equiv.Perm (Fin 3).
  Show (Equiv.swap 0 1 * Equiv.swap 0 2) ≠ (Equiv.swap 0 2 * Equiv.swap 0 1).
