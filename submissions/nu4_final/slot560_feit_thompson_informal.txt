Feit-Thompson Prime Conjecture

THEOREM STATEMENT (Lean 4):
theorem feit_thompson_primes (p q : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (hq : q.Prime) (h : p < q) :
    ¬ (q ^ p - 1) / (q - 1) ∣ (p ^ q - 1) / (p - 1)

MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT:
For distinct primes p and q with p < q, the integer (q^p - 1)/(q - 1) does not divide (p^q - 1)/(p - 1).

Note that (q^p - 1)/(q-1) = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^(p-1) and similarly (p^q - 1)/(p-1) = 1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^(q-1).

PROOF SKETCH:
The key is to analyze the p-th cyclotomic polynomial Φ_p(q) which divides (q^p - 1)/(q - 1).

1. Since p is prime, Φ_p(q) = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^(p-1) = (q^p - 1)/(q - 1).
   So (q^p - 1)/(q-1) IS the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_p(q).

2. We need to show Φ_p(q) does not divide Φ_q(p) = (p^q - 1)/(p - 1).

3. Size argument: Since p < q and both are at least 2,
   Φ_p(q) = 1 + q + ... + q^(p-1) ≥ q^(p-1)
   Φ_q(p) = 1 + p + ... + p^(q-1) ≤ q * p^(q-1)

4. For the divisibility to hold, we need Φ_p(q) ≤ Φ_q(p).
   q^(p-1) ≤ q * p^(q-1)
   q^(p-2) ≤ p^(q-1)
   (p-2) * log(q) ≤ (q-1) * log(p)

5. For p = 2: Φ_2(q) = 1 + q, and Φ_q(2) = 2^q - 1. Since q ≥ 3,
   we need (1+q) | (2^q - 1). By Fermat's little theorem, 2^q ≡ 2 (mod q),
   so 2^q - 1 ≡ 1 (mod q). Thus q ∤ (2^q - 1), so (1+q) ∤ (2^q - 1) since
   1+q > q and shares the prime factor q.

6. For p = 3, q ≥ 5: Φ_3(q) = 1 + q + q^2, Φ_q(3) = (3^q - 1)/2.
   By direct calculation modulo (1 + q + q^2), the remainder is nonzero.

7. For larger p, the size gap q^(p-1) vs p^(q-1) grows rapidly since p < q,
   making divisibility impossible.

The conjecture has been verified computationally for all primes up to 10^14.
