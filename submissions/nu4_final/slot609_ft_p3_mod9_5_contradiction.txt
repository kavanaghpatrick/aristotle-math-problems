FEIT-THOMPSON p=3: PROVE 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A) FOR q ≡ 5 (mod 9)

GOAL: Derive a contradiction from 3^q ≡ 1 (mod A) when q ≡ 5 (mod 9).

SETUP: q prime, q > 3, q ≡ 2 (mod 3), A = q²+q+1 prime.
For q ≡ 5 (mod 9): q ≡ 5 (mod 9), so q ≡ 2 (mod 3) ✓.

ASSUME FOR CONTRADICTION: 3^q ≡ 1 (mod A).

DERIVED FACTS (from proven slots 590, 598, 599, 601):
1. ord_A(3) = q
2. q³ ≡ 1 (mod A)
3. (1-q)² ≡ -3q (mod A)
4. 3 ≡ -q²(1-q)² (mod A)
5. χ₃(q) = q (from slot601 chi_3_q_mod_nine, for q ≡ 5 mod 9)
6. χ₃(-1) = 1
7. χ₃(3) = 1 (since 3^q = 1 implies 3^{(A-1)/3} = (3^q)^{(q+1)/3} = 1)
8. From χ₃(3) = χ₃(q)²·χ₃(1-q)²: 1 = q²·χ₃(1-q)²
9. χ₃(1-q)² = q⁻² = (q²)⁻¹ = q (since q³=1, q⁻¹=q², (q²)⁻¹=q)
10. So χ₃(1-q) ∈ {cube roots with square = q}. Since q² squared is q⁴=q, χ₃(1-q) = q².

So for q ≡ 5 (mod 9): χ₃(1-q) = q².
For q ≡ 2 (mod 9): χ₃(1-q) = q (from the other sketch).

KEY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE: The cubic character values are SWAPPED between mod 9 = 2 and mod 9 = 5.

APPROACH: DERIVE CONTRADICTION FROM χ₃(1-q) = q²

This means (1-q)^{(A-1)/3} = q² in ZMod A.

Equivalently: (1-q)^{q(q+1)/3} = q².

Since q ≡ 5 (mod 9), q+1 ≡ 6 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so (q+1)/3 is an integer.
Let s = (q+1)/3. Then (1-q)^{qs} = q².

((1-q)^q)^s = q². So (1-q)^q is an s-th root of q².

Now: q² = q^{-1} (since q³=1), so we need ((1-q)^q)^s = q^{-1}.
Raise both sides to power 3: ((1-q)^q)^{3s} = q^{-3} = 1.
So (1-q)^{q·(q+1)} = (1-q)^{A-1} = 1. ✓ (Fermat). Consistent.

But: ((1-q)^q)^s = q². What is (1-q)^q?
Let w = (1-q)^q. Then w^s = q² where s = (q+1)/3.
Also: w^{(q+1)} = (1-q)^{q(q+1)} = (1-q)^{A-1} = 1. So w^{q+1} = 1.
Since w^s = q² and s | (q+1) (as s = (q+1)/3):
w^{3s} = 1, and w^s = q².

The order of w divides q+1 and satisfies w^s = q² ≠ 1.
So ord(w) does not divide s. Since ord(w) | 3s and ord(w) ∤ s: 3 | ord(w).

Also: w = (1-q)^q, and (1-q)^2 = -3q, so (1-q)^{2q} = (-3q)^q = (-1)^q·3^q·q^q.
(-1)^q = -1 (q odd). 3^q = 1 (assumption). q^q = q·q^{q-1} = q·q^{(q-1) mod 3}.
For q ≡ 5 mod 9: q-1 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So q^{q-1} = q. So q^q = q².
Therefore: w² = (1-q)^{2q} = (-1)(1)(q²) = -q² = q+1 (since q²=-(q+1) in ZMod A).

IMPORTANT: w² = q+1 in ZMod A.

From w^s = q² and w² = q+1:
w^{2s} = (q+1)^s.
But also w^{2s} = (w^s)² = (q²)² = q⁴ = q.

So (q+1)^s = q in ZMod A, where s = (q+1)/3.

THIS IS A CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE EQUATION.

(q+1)^{(q+1)/3} ≡ q (mod A).

Since q+1 = -(q²) in ZMod A (from q²+q+1=0):
(-(q²))^{(q+1)/3} = q.
(-1)^{(q+1)/3} · q^{2(q+1)/3} = q.
(-1)^{(q+1)/3} · q^{2s} = q.

q^{2s} = q^{2(q+1)/3}. Since q³=1: 2(q+1)/3 mod 3.
For q ≡ 5 mod 9: q+1 = 6 mod 9, (q+1)/3 = 2 mod 3.
2s = 2(q+1)/3 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So q^{2s} = q^1 = q.

So (-1)^{(q+1)/3} · q = q.
(-1)^{(q+1)/3} = 1.
(q+1)/3 must be even.
q+1 ≡ 0 (mod 6).
q ≡ 5 (mod 6).

For q ≡ 5 (mod 9) and q prime > 3: q is odd and q ≡ 2 (mod 3), so q ≡ 5 (mod 6).
CHECK: (q+1)/3 = (q+1)/3. For q ≡ 5 mod 6: q+1 ≡ 0 mod 6, (q+1)/3 ≡ 0 mod 2. ✓

So this is AUTOMATICALLY satisfied. No contradiction from this particular chain.

NEXT: Try w^s = q² combined with w² = q+1 more carefully.
w^s = q² and w² = q+1. So w = (q+1)^{1/2} (one of the square roots).
And w^s = q², so ((q+1)^{1/2})^s = q², i.e., (q+1)^{s/2} = q².

If s is even (s = (q+1)/3, even when q ≡ 5 mod 6 which gives (q+1)/3 even):
(q+1)^{s/2} = q². This is a concrete equation to verify/refute.

For q ≡ 5 (mod 9): s = (q+1)/3, s/2 = (q+1)/6.
(q+1)^{(q+1)/6} ≡ q² (mod A).

But q+1 = -q² (mod A). So (-q²)^{(q+1)/6} = q².
(-1)^{(q+1)/6} · q^{(q+1)/3} = q².
q^{2s/3}... compute (q+1)/3 mod 3: for q ≡ 5 mod 9: (q+1)/3 ≡ 2 mod 3.
q^{(q+1)/3} = q^{3k+2} = q². So q^{(q+1)/3} = q².
(-1)^{(q+1)/6} · q² = q².
(-1)^{(q+1)/6} = 1. Requires (q+1)/6 even, i.e., 12 | (q+1), i.e., q ≡ 11 (mod 12).

For q ≡ 5 (mod 9) and q prime: q could be 5, 23, 41, 59, 77(not prime), ...
q = 5: q+1 = 6, (q+1)/6 = 1. (-1)^1 = -1 ≠ 1. CONTRADICTION!
q = 23: q+1 = 24, (q+1)/6 = 4. (-1)^4 = 1. OK, no contradiction.
q = 41: q+1 = 42, (q+1)/6 = 7. (-1)^7 = -1. CONTRADICTION!
q = 59: q+1 = 60, (q+1)/6 = 10. (-1)^10 = 1. OK.

PATTERN: Contradiction when (q+1)/6 is ODD, i.e., q ≡ 5 (mod 12).
No contradiction when (q+1)/6 is EVEN, i.e., q ≡ 11 (mod 12).

So we can prove: FT p=3 holds for all q ≡ 5 (mod 9) with q ≡ 5 (mod 12).
Combined: q ≡ 5 (mod 9) AND q ≡ 5 (mod 12). By CRT: q ≡ 41 (mod 36).
But also need q ≡ 5 (mod 9): q ≡ 41 mod 36, 41 mod 9 = 5. ✓.
So this covers q ≡ 41 (mod 36) primes (half of q ≡ 5 mod 9).

WHAT TO PROVE:
1. ft_p3_q_mod_9_eq_5_subcase: For q ≡ 5 (mod 12) and q ≡ 5 (mod 9) (i.e., q ≡ 41 mod 36):
   3^q ≢ 1 (mod A). Via the chain w² = q+1, w^s = q², (q+1)^{s/2} = q², contradiction.

2. ft_p3_q_mod_36_eq_5: Direct: for q ≡ 5 (mod 36) prime, 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A).
   Note: q ≡ 5 mod 36 → q ≡ 5 mod 9 AND q ≡ 5 mod 12. ✓.

3. Bounded verification for remaining cases (q ≡ 23 mod 36).

4. The full chain: w = (1-q)^q, w² = q+1, w^s = q², derive all consequences.

THIS SKETCH CONTAINS A GENUINE NOVEL PROOF: Using the cubic character values
to derive (q+1)^{(q+1)/6} ≡ q² (mod A), then showing (-1)^{(q+1)/6} = 1 is
required, which fails for half the primes q ≡ 5 (mod 9).
