Theorem: No p-group is a Leinster group.

This is a KNOWN result from Leinster (2001), "Perfect numbers and groups", but has
NOT been formalized in Lean 4 / Mathlib. This would be a FIRST-EVER formalization.

=== Definition ===

A finite group G is a Leinster group if the sum of the orders of all its normal
subgroups equals twice the group's order:

  ∑ H : {H : Subgroup G // H.Normal}, Nat.card H = 2 * Fintype.card G

This is the same definition used in FormalConjectures/Wikipedia/LeinsterGroup.lean.

=== Theorem Statement ===

theorem no_pgroup_is_leinster (G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G] [IsPGroup p G]
    (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hG : 1 < Fintype.card G) :
    ¬ IsLeinster G

=== Proof Strategy (modular arithmetic) ===

The proof is elegant and uses modular arithmetic:

1. In any finite group G, {e} is always a normal subgroup with |{e}| = 1.

2. Every OTHER normal subgroup H of G (with H ≠ {e}) has order divisible by p,
   because G is a p-group: if H is a subgroup of a p-group, then |H| is a power
   of p, so p | |H| when |H| > 1.

3. Therefore: sum of all normal subgroup orders ≡ 1 (mod p).
   - The trivial subgroup contributes 1
   - Every nontrivial normal subgroup contributes 0 (mod p)
   - Total: 1 + 0 + 0 + ... ≡ 1 (mod p)

4. But 2 * |G| ≡ 0 (mod p), since |G| is a power of p (with exponent ≥ 1).

5. Since 1 ≢ 0 (mod p) for any prime p ≥ 2, we have:
   ∑ |H| ≠ 2 * |G|

=== Key Mathlib ingredients ===

- `IsPGroup`: exists in Mathlib, characterizes p-groups
- `Subgroup.card_dvd_of_le`: subgroup order divides group order
- `IsPGroup.card_eq_or_dvd`: in a p-group, subgroup orders are powers of p
- `Nat.Prime.one_lt`: p ≥ 2
- `Finset.sum_congr` and modular arithmetic
- The key modular step: if all terms except one are ≡ 0 (mod p), and one term is 1,
  then the sum ≡ 1 (mod p)

=== Alternative approach via Finset.sum ===

Can also prove by showing:
  Let S = ∑_{H normal} |H|
  S = 1 + ∑_{H normal, H ≠ {e}} |H|
  Each term in the second sum is ≡ 0 (mod p)
  So S ≡ 1 (mod p)
  But 2|G| ≡ 0 (mod p)
  So S ≠ 2|G|

The formalization should:
1. Split the sum into the trivial subgroup and the rest
2. Show each nontrivial normal subgroup of a p-group has order divisible by p
3. Conclude by modular arithmetic contradiction

This is a clean, self-contained proof with no dependencies on other Leinster results.
