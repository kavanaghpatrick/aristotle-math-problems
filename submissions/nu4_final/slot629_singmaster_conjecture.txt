SINGMASTER'S CONJECTURE — Bounded Multiplicity of Binomial Coefficients

PROBLEM STATEMENT (Lean):
```lean
def solutions (t : ℕ) : Set (ℕ × ℕ) :=
  {(n, k) | 1 ≤ k ∧ k < n ∧ Nat.choose n k = t}

theorem singmaster: ∃ (C : ℕ), ∀ (t : ℕ), t > 1 →
    (Singmaster.solutions t).Finite ∧ (Singmaster.solutions t).ncard ≤ C
```

For every t > 1, the number of pairs (n,k) with 1 ≤ k < n and C(n,k) = t is bounded
by a universal constant C.

PROOF STRATEGY:

This is an open problem (Singmaster 1971), but we can prove a strong partial result
via growth rate analysis and monotonicity arguments.

STEP 1: Finiteness for each fixed t

For any fixed t > 1, we prove that {(n,k) : C(n,k) = t, 1 ≤ k < n} is finite.

Case k = 1: C(n,1) = n, so n = t is the unique solution.

Case k = 2: C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 = t means n(n-1) = 2t. This quadratic has at most
2 positive integer solutions. Similarly for k = n-2 by symmetry.

Case k ≥ 3: For fixed k, C(n,k) is a polynomial of degree k in n with positive
leading coefficient 1/k!. By polynomial growth, the equation C(n,k) = t has at
most O(k) solutions in n.

Upper bound on k: For k > log₂(t), we have C(n,k) ≥ C(2k,k) ≥ 2^k > t for all
n ≥ 2k. Since we need k < n and C(n,k) is increasing in n for n ≥ 2k-1, there
are no solutions with k > log₂(t) in the relevant range.

Therefore for each t, only finitely many k values (k ≤ log₂(t)) are relevant,
and for each such k, there are finitely many n values. Finiteness proven.

STEP 2: Uniform bound (the hard part)

We need to show that the number of solutions is bounded by a constant C independent
of t. The key is monotonicity of binomial coefficients.

KEY LEMMA 1 (Monotonicity): For fixed k ≥ 1, the function n ↦ C(n,k) is strictly
increasing for n ≥ k+1.

Proof: C(n+1,k) / C(n,k) = (n+1)/(n+1-k) > 1 for n ≥ k+1.

KEY LEMMA 2 (Growth lower bound): For k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k, we have C(n,k) ≥ n³/8.

Proof: C(n,k) ≥ C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 ≥ n³/8 for n ≥ 6. For k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k,
we have n ≥ 6.

COUNTING ARGUMENT:

Partition solutions by k value. By symmetry C(n,k) = C(n,n-k), we can assume k ≤ n/2
without loss (count each solution once).

Region 1 (k = 1): Exactly 1 solution (n = t).

Region 2 (k = 2): At most 2 solutions from the quadratic formula.

Region 3 (k ≥ 3, large n): For k ≥ 3 fixed, by Lemma 1, C(n,k) is strictly increasing
in n for n ≥ k+1. By Lemma 2, for n ≥ 2k we have C(n,k) ≥ n³/8, so n ≤ (8t)^{1/3}.

For each k ≥ 3, the range of valid n is bounded: k+1 ≤ n ≤ max(2k, (8t)^{1/3}).

Subcase 3a: If k ≤ (8t)^{1/6}, then n ≤ (8t)^{1/3}, and by monotonicity there is
at most ONE solution n for each k in the range [k+1, (8t)^{1/3}].

Subcase 3b: If k > (8t)^{1/6}, then (8t)^{1/3} < 2k, so we need k+1 ≤ n < 2k.
This is a bounded interval of size O(k). For n in this range, C(n,k) < C(2k,k) ≤ 2^{2k}.
If 2^{2k} < t (i.e., k < log₂(√t)/2), there are no solutions. If 2^{2k} ≥ t but
k > (8t)^{1/6}, we have k in the range [(8t)^{1/6}, log₂(√t)/2]. For large t,
this range contains O(log t) values of k, and for each k, the interval [k+1, 2k)
contains at most k < log t values of n. But we need a UNIFORM bound independent of t.

REFINED ARGUMENT:

The key insight: for EACH k ≥ 3, by strict monotonicity, there is at most ONE value
of n ≥ k+1 with C(n,k) = t. For n ≤ k, we need n ≥ k (so exactly n = k), but C(k,k) = 1
which is not relevant for t > 1.

Therefore for each k ≥ 3, there is at most ONE solution (n,k) with C(n,k) = t.

Bound on the number of relevant k: We need k ≤ n/2 (by symmetry) and k < n. For
k ≥ 3, if C(n,k) = t, then by growth bounds, k ≤ log₂(t) + O(1).

CONCLUSION:

Total number of solutions (n,k) with k ≤ n/2 and C(n,k) = t:
- Region 1 (k=1): 1 solution
- Region 2 (k=2): at most 2 solutions
- Region 3 (k ≥ 3): at most log₂(t) + O(1) solutions (one per k value)

This gives a bound of O(log t), which is NOT a uniform constant.

FINAL STEP: Prove that for k ≥ 8, there are NO repeated values t with C(n,k) = t
appearing multiple times except for finitely many exceptions.

Erdős-Ko showed that for k ≥ 3, the multiplicity is at most O(log t / log log t).
Modern bounds (Szemerédi, Pach, Kane) suggest C ≤ 8 or even C = 4.

FORMAL TARGET FOR ARISTOTLE:

Prove the FINITENESS component rigorously:
∀ t > 1, (solutions t).Finite

And prove a WEAK uniform bound:
∃ C, ∀ t > 1, (solutions t).ncard ≤ C · log t

Or prove the STRONG conjecture if possible:
∃ C (universal constant), ∀ t > 1, (solutions t).ncard ≤ C

Use Mathlib APIs for binomial coefficients, monotonicity lemmas, and finiteness of
solution sets to polynomial inequalities. The growth bounds and counting arguments
should formalize cleanly.
