CONTINUATION: Feit-Thompson Conjecture — Complete the p=3 case

This is a CONTINUATION of a previous Aristotle run that proved 14 structural lemmas.
The budget was exhausted before completing the proof. We now focus on completing
the p=3 case, which is the hardest remaining case.

=== What is already proven (from previous run) ===

The following lemmas are ALL PROVEN with 0 sorry:

1. feit_thompson_primes_p_eq_2: For p=2, the conjecture holds.
2. feit_thompson_prime_divisor_congruence: If prime r divides both
   Phi_p(q) = (q^p-1)/(q-1) and Phi_q(p) = (p^q-1)/(p-1), then r ≡ 1 (mod pq).
3. feit_thompson_congruence_1_mod_pq: If Phi_p(q) | Phi_q(p), then
   Phi_p(q) ≡ 1 (mod pq).
4. feit_thompson_mod_p: If Phi_p(q) | Phi_q(p), then q ≢ 1 (mod p).
5. feit_thompson_size_lemma: q^(p-1) < p^q for primes p < q.
6. feit_thompson_B_cong_1_mod_pq: (p^q-1)/(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod pq).
7. feit_thompson_p_eq_3_A_prime: For p=3, if divisibility holds, then
   A = q^2+q+1 is prime.
8. feit_thompson_q_mod_3: For p=3, if divisibility holds, then q ≡ 2 (mod 3).
9. jacobi_three_eq_neg_one: (3/A) = -1 when q ≡ 1 (mod 4) and q ≡ 2 (mod 3).
10. three_pow_q_ne_one_mod_A_of_q_mod_4_eq_1: When q ≡ 1 (mod 4), q ≡ 2 (mod 3),
    and A = q^2+q+1 is prime: 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A).

=== What remains for p=3 ===

For p=3, we know:
- A = q^2+q+1 must be prime (lemma 7)
- q ≡ 2 (mod 3) (lemma 8)
- A | Phi_q(3) = (3^q-1)/2, so 3^q ≡ 1 (mod A)

Split by q mod 4:

CASE q ≡ 1 (mod 4): DONE by lemma 10.
  3^q ≢ 1 (mod A) contradicts A | (3^q-1)/2.

CASE q ≡ 3 (mod 4): Need cubic residue argument.
  Since q ≡ 2 (mod 3), we have q ≡ 2 (mod 3) and q ≡ 3 (mod 4).
  So q ≡ 11 (mod 12).

  Key idea: Since A ≡ 1 (mod 3) (A = q^2+q+1, and q ≡ 2 mod 3 gives
  A ≡ 4+2+1 = 7 ≡ 1 mod 3), the group (Z/AZ)* has a unique subgroup
  of index 3. If 3^q ≡ 1 (mod A), then 3 is a cube mod A (since
  3q ≡ 0 (mod q) and q | A-1 by Fermat).

  But if q ≡ 3 (mod 4), then (3/A) = ... using quadratic reciprocity
  and the fact that A = q^2+q+1 ≡ 1+q (mod 2) ≡ 0 (mod 2)... wait,
  A = q^2+q+1 is always odd (q^2+q = q(q+1) is even, plus 1 is odd).

  Actually for q ≡ 3 (mod 4): we need a different approach.

  Approach: Show 3 is NOT a cube mod A using cubic reciprocity.

  Since A is prime and A ≡ 1 (mod 3), cubic reciprocity applies.
  The cubic residue symbol (3/A)_3 depends on the representation
  A = a^2 + 3b^2 (Gauss's form for primes ≡ 1 mod 3).

  Alternative approach: Show that ord_A(3) = q (not a divisor of q).
  Since q is prime, ord_A(3) | q implies ord_A(3) ∈ {1, q}.
  If ord_A(3) = 1, then A | 2, impossible since A > 2.
  So ord_A(3) = q. But q does not divide A-1 = q^2+q = q(q+1),
  actually q DOES divide A-1 = q(q+1), so ord_A(3) | q is compatible.

  Wait — actually A-1 = q^2+q = q(q+1). So |group| = q(q+1).
  ord_A(3) | q(q+1). If 3^q ≡ 1 mod A, then ord | q, so ord ∈ {1, q}.

  Hmm, the contradiction must come from showing that 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A)
  for q ≡ 3 (mod 4) using cubic residue theory.

=== Recommended approach for Aristotle ===

GOAL: Prove the p=3 case of Feit-Thompson:
  ∀ q prime, 3 < q → ¬ (q^2+q+1 | (3^q-1)/2)

Use the already-proven lemmas 7 and 8 (A is prime, q ≡ 2 mod 3).

For q ≡ 1 (mod 4): Already done (lemma 10).

For q ≡ 3 (mod 4): Need to show 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A).
  Key insight: Since A ≡ 1 (mod 3), and 3 | (A-1) = q(q+1), the
  multiplicative order of 3 mod A must divide q(q+1). If 3^q ≡ 1 mod A,
  then ord_A(3) | q. Since q is prime, ord_A(3) = 1 or q.

  If ord_A(3) = 1: 3 ≡ 1 mod A, so A | 2. Impossible.
  If ord_A(3) = q: Then 3^((q+1)/2) ≢ 1 mod A (since q is odd and
  (q+1)/2 does not divide q). But by Euler's criterion,
  3^((A-1)/2) = (3/A) mod A. Since A-1 = q(q+1), (A-1)/2 = q(q+1)/2.

  Use the Jacobi symbol (3/A) for q ≡ 3 mod 4:
  For A ≡ ... compute (3/A) using quadratic reciprocity.

If this is too complex, alternatively try native_decide on the p=3
case for all q < 10000.
