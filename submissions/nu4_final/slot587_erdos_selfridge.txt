Theorem (Erdős-Selfridge 1975): The product of k ≥ 2 consecutive positive integers
is never a perfect power.

This is a FAMOUS known result, published in Illinois J. Math. 19(2): 292-301, 1975.
NOT yet formalized in Lean 4 / Mathlib. Would be a FIRST-EVER formalization of a
classic number theory theorem.

=== Formal Statement ===

theorem erdos_selfridge (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) (x l : ℕ) (hl : 2 ≤ l) :
    (∏ i ∈ Finset.Ioc n (n + k), i) ≠ x ^ l

Equivalently: n(n+1)(n+2)...(n+k-1) ≠ x^l for any n ≥ 1, k ≥ 2, l ≥ 2.

=== Proof Strategy ===

The proof proceeds by contradiction. Assume ∏_{i=n+1}^{n+k} i = x^l.

**Key idea**: Since consecutive integers have controlled gcd structure, each factor
(n+i) in the product must "almost" be an l-th power. The proof analyzes the prime
factorization to derive a contradiction.

**Step 1: Factor decomposition**
For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, write n+i = a_i * b_i^l where a_i is l-th-power-free
(i.e., for every prime p, v_p(a_i) < l). Then ∏ a_i * (∏ b_i)^l = x^l,
so ∏ a_i must itself be an l-th power.

**Step 2: The a_i are small**
Each a_i divides the product of primes ≤ k (since if p > k, then p divides
at most one of n+1, ..., n+k, and if p | n+i then p^l | n+i from the l-th
power structure). So a_i | k! (roughly).

**Step 3: Coprimality constraints**
For i ≠ j, gcd(n+i, n+j) | (j-i) ≤ k-1. This constrains the a_i values
and forces many a_i to be coprime.

**Step 4: Contradiction via descent**
The product ∏ a_i is an l-th power, but each a_i is l-th-power-free and
bounded by k!. For l ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2, this forces all a_i = 1 (or leads to
impossible constraints), which means each n+i is an l-th power. But l-th
powers grow too fast — there can't be k ≥ 2 consecutive l-th powers among
consecutive integers (for n ≥ 1).

=== Simpler special cases (Aristotle should prove at least these) ===

**Case k = 2**: n(n+1) = x^l.
Since gcd(n, n+1) = 1, both n and n+1 must be l-th powers.
Say n = a^l, n+1 = b^l. Then b^l - a^l = 1.
For l = 2: (b-a)(b+a) = 1, so b = 1, a = 0, n = 0. Contradicts n ≥ 1.
For l ≥ 3: b^l - a^l ≥ (a+1)^l - a^l ≥ l*a^{l-1} + 1 > 1 for a ≥ 1.
So a = 0, n = 0. Contradicts n ≥ 1.

**Case l = 2 (product of k consecutive integers never a perfect square)**:
This uses the argument that among k ≥ 2 consecutive integers, at most one
can be divisible by a given prime p to high power. Standard approach uses
Bertrand's postulate: there exists a prime p with k/2 < p ≤ k. This prime
p divides exactly one of n+1, ..., n+k (since consecutive integers, gap < 2p).
So v_p of the product is exactly v_p(n+i) for some i, which is odd if not
a square. This prime contributes an odd exponent, contradicting perfect square.
(This argument needs care for small k but the core idea works.)

=== Recommended scope for Aristotle ===

Priority 1: Prove the k=2 case (product of two consecutive integers never a
perfect power). This is clean and elementary.

Priority 2: Prove the l=2 case (product of k ≥ 2 consecutive integers never
a perfect square). Uses Bertrand's postulate from Mathlib.

Priority 3: Full theorem if possible.

=== Key Mathlib ingredients ===

- `Nat.Coprime.of_succ_right`: gcd(n, n+1) = 1
- `Nat.eq_one_of_pos_of_self_mul_self_eq`: for perfect square arguments
- `Nat.exists_prime_and_dvd`: prime factorization
- Bertrand's postulate: exists in Mathlib as `Nat.bertrand`
- `Finset.prod_Ioc`: product over interval
- `Nat.Prime.dvd_mul`: prime divides product iff divides factor
