Theorem: Every odd integer n with 1 < n < 10^7 can be written as the sum of a
squarefree number and a power of 2.

This is a KNOWN bounded verification result for Erdős Problem 11.
The full conjecture (all odd n > 1) is OPEN.
This bounded case is marked as solved in the formal-conjectures repository.

=== Formal Statement ===

theorem erdos_11_bounded (n : ℕ) (hn : Odd n) (h : n < 10^7) (hn' : 1 < n) :
    ∃ k l : ℕ, Squarefree k ∧ n = k + 2^l

=== What "squarefree" means ===

A natural number k is squarefree if no perfect square > 1 divides it.
Equivalently, for every prime p, v_p(k) ≤ 1.
In Mathlib: `Squarefree k` means ∀ d, d^2 ∣ k → IsUnit d.

=== Proof Strategy ===

The approach is algorithmic: for each odd n in (1, 10^7), find some power
2^l ≤ n such that n - 2^l is squarefree.

**Why this works**: For any n, the powers of 2 less than n are 1, 2, 4, 8, ...,
up to about log₂(n) ≈ 23 values. For each, n - 2^l is a candidate. The density
of squarefree numbers is 6/π² ≈ 0.608, so with ~23 candidates, the probability
that ALL of them are non-squarefree is roughly (1 - 6/π²)^23 ≈ 10^{-9}.
So it's overwhelmingly likely that at least one works, and verified computationally.

**Formalization approach**: This is a decidable property. For bounded n, we can use
a decision procedure:

1. Define a decidable predicate: hasSquarefreeDecomp(n) = ∃ l ≤ log₂(n), Squarefree(n - 2^l)
2. Prove this predicate is decidable (Squarefree is decidable for naturals)
3. Use native_decide to verify for all odd n in (1, 10^7)

Note: 10^7 might be too large for native_decide. If so, Aristotle should prove
a smaller bound (e.g., n < 10^4 or n < 10^5) that is still mathematically
meaningful.

=== Alternative: smaller bound ===

If 10^7 is too large, prove:

theorem erdos_11_bounded_small (n : ℕ) (hn : Odd n) (h : n < 10000) (hn' : 1 < n) :
    ∃ k l : ℕ, Squarefree k ∧ n = k + 2^l

This would still be a first-ever formalization of even a bounded Erdős 11 result.

=== Key Mathlib ingredients ===

- `Squarefree`: defined in Mathlib, decidable for ℕ
- `Nat.Squarefree_iff_prime_squarefree`: squarefree iff no prime squared divides
- `Odd`: decidable
- `native_decide` or `decide` for bounded verification
- `Nat.log`: for bounding the search range

=== Proof sketch for decision procedure ===

def hasDecomp (n : ℕ) : Bool :=
  -- Check if n - 2^l is squarefree for some l
  let max_l := Nat.log 2 n
  (List.range (max_l + 1)).any fun l =>
    let k := n - 2^l
    k > 0 && isSquarefree k

where isSquarefree checks that no p² divides k for primes p ≤ √k.

Then prove: hasDecomp n = true ↔ ∃ k l, Squarefree k ∧ n = k + 2^l
And use native_decide on: ∀ n ∈ Finset.range 10000, Odd n → 1 < n → hasDecomp n

=== Value ===

Even a bounded result is meaningful because:
1. First-ever formalization of ANY case of Erdős 11
2. Demonstrates the computational approach for the full conjecture
3. The bound 10^7 or 10^4 is a concrete verified range
