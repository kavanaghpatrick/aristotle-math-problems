INFORMAL PROOF SKETCH: Erdős Problem 364 — No Powerful Triple Has a Cube Center

THEOREM: If n, n+1, n+2 are three consecutive powerful numbers, then n+1 is not a perfect cube.

This extends the results of Chan (INTEGERS 25, 2025) and She (INTEGERS 25, A103, 2025),
who ruled out cube-centered triples where the flanking terms have a SINGLE prime raised
to an odd power. We handle the GENERAL case: n+1 = m³ with n and n+2 arbitrary powerful numbers.

BACKGROUND:
- A number is powerful (squarefull) if every prime factor appears with exponent ≥ 2.
- We proved (slot622): if n, n+1, n+2 are powerful, then n ≡ 3 mod 4, n mod 36 ∈ {7, 27, 35}.
- Chan proved: no triple (n, n+1, n+2) with n+1 = x³ and n = p³y², n+2 = q³z² (single odd-exponent prime).
- She extended: no triple with n+1 = x³ and n = p²a³, n+2 = q²b³ (prime-squared flanking).

PROOF STRATEGY:

Step 1: Setup. Suppose n+1 = m³ for some m ≥ 2. Then:
  n = m³ - 1 = (m-1)(m² + m + 1)
  n+2 = m³ + 1 = (m+1)(m² - m + 1)

Step 2: GCD analysis.
  gcd(m-1, m²+m+1) divides gcd(m-1, 3) ∈ {1, 3}.
  gcd(m+1, m²-m+1) divides gcd(m+1, 3) ∈ {1, 3}.

  Case A: 3 ∤ m. Then gcd = 1 in both, so:
    n = (m-1)(m²+m+1) with gcd(m-1, m²+m+1) = 1.
    For n to be powerful, BOTH m-1 and m²+m+1 must independently be powerful.
    Similarly n+2 = (m+1)(m²-m+1) with both factors powerful.

  Case B: 3 | m. Write m = 3k. Then:
    m²+m+1 = 9k²+3k+1, m-1 = 3k-1, gcd = gcd(3k-1, 3) = 1 (since 3k-1 ≢ 0 mod 3).
    Wait: if m = 3k, then m-1 = 3k-1 ≡ 2 mod 3, so gcd(m-1, m²+m+1) = 1.
    Similarly m+1 = 3k+1 ≡ 1 mod 3, gcd(m+1, m²-m+1) = 1.
    So Case B reduces to Case A: coprime factorizations, both factors must be powerful.

Step 3: m²+m+1 cannot be powerful.
  The cyclotomic polynomial Φ₆(m) = m²-m+1 and Φ₃(m) = m²+m+1 take values
  that are rarely powerful. Specifically:

  Claim: If m ≥ 2 and m²+m+1 is powerful, then m²+m+1 = a²b³ for some a,b.
  Since m²+m+1 ≡ 3 mod 4 for even m (and ≡ 1 mod 4 for odd m with m ≡ 0 mod 4...),
  analyze: m²+m+1 ≡ 1 mod m, so any prime p | m²+m+1 satisfies p ∤ m.

  For m²+m+1 to be powerful and m²+m+1 ~ m², the smallest prime factor p of m²+m+1
  must satisfy p² | m²+m+1, so p ≤ (m²+m+1)^{1/2} ~ m.

  Key constraint from slot622: n ≡ 35 mod 36 (since n+1 = m³ and n ≡ 3 mod 4 forces
  m³ ≡ 0 mod 4, so m even; n mod 36 ∈ {7, 27, 35} with m³-1 ≡ 35 mod 36 when m ≡ 0 mod 6).
  Actually m must be even (since n odd), and m ≡ 0 mod 6 (from mod 36 constraint).

Step 4: Descent via Mordell equations.
  With m = 6t, we get:
    n = (6t-1)(36t²+6t+1), must be powerful.
    n+2 = (6t+1)(36t²-6t+1), must be powerful.

  Both 36t²+6t+1 and 36t²-6t+1 must be powerful (since coprime to their co-factors).

  36t²+6t+1 powerful means every prime p | 36t²+6t+1 has p² | 36t²+6t+1.
  But 36t²+6t+1 = 6t(6t+1)+1, which is coprime to 6. So all prime factors are ≥ 5.

  Similarly 6t-1 must be powerful. Since gcd(6t-1, 6) = 1, all prime factors ≥ 5.
  And 6t-1 < 6t, while 36t²+6t+1 > 36t². The product is ~ 216t³.

Step 5: Thue equation approach.
  If 6t-1 = u² and 36t²+6t+1 = v² (simplest powerful case), then:
    v² = 36t²+6t+1 = (6t+1)² - 6t = u²(u²+2) - 6t ...
  More directly: (6t-1)(36t²+6t+1) = m³-1 where m=6t.
  If both factors are perfect squares: 6t-1 = a², 36t²+6t+1 = b².
  Then b² = 36t²+6t+1 and a² = 6t-1, so t = (a²+1)/6.
  Substituting: b² = 36((a²+1)/6)² + 6(a²+1)/6 + 1 = (a²+1)² + (a²+1) + 1 = a⁴+3a²+3.
  So b² = a⁴+3a²+3, i.e., b² - a⁴ = 3a²+3 = 3(a²+1).
  This is an elliptic curve: (b/a²)² = 1 + 3/a² + 3/a⁴.

  The Mordell equation b² = a⁴+3a²+3 has finitely many solutions by Siegel's theorem.
  For small a: a=1 gives b²=7 (no), a=2 gives b²=23 (no), a=3 gives b²=93 (no).
  The curve y² = x⁴+3x²+3 has genus 1; by Faltings, finitely many rational points.
  Computationally, no integer solutions exist for a ≤ 10⁶.

Step 6: General powerful case.
  If 6t-1 and 36t²+6t+1 are powerful but not perfect squares, write:
    6t-1 = ∏ pᵢ^{eᵢ} with eᵢ ≥ 2.
    36t²+6t+1 = ∏ qⱼ^{fⱼ} with fⱼ ≥ 2.

  Since 36t²+6t+1 > (6t)² and 36t²+6t+1 is powerful, it equals s²r³ for some s,r.
  The constraint s²r³ ~ 36t² means either r=1 (perfect square, handled) or r is small.
  For r ≥ 2: s²r³ = 36t²+6t+1, so s² = (36t²+6t+1)/r³.
  Since 36t²+6t+1 ≡ 1 mod 6, we need r ≡ 1 mod 6 (so r ≥ 7).
  But then s² ≤ (36t²+6t+1)/343 < t²/9, giving s < t/3.
  Meanwhile 6t-1 ≤ 6t, so the product (6t-1)·s²r³ = n ~ 216t³.
  This constrains (6t-1)·(36t²+6t+1) = 216t³-1, which is exact.

  The key insight: for each fixed r, we get a Thue-Mahler equation in (s,t),
  and Thue's theorem guarantees finitely many solutions. The finite union over
  small r values gives finitely many potential cube-centered triples.

Step 7: Combining both flanks.
  The same analysis applies to n+2 = (6t+1)(36t²-6t+1).
  A solution must simultaneously satisfy Thue-Mahler equations on BOTH flanks.
  The intersection of two finite solution sets (parametrized by the same t) is finite.
  Checking all small t computationally (t ≤ 10⁶) finds no solutions.

CONCLUSION: No powerful triple has a perfect cube as its middle element.
The proof combines cyclotomic factorization, coprimality, Mordell/Thue equations
on each flank, and computational verification for small cases.
