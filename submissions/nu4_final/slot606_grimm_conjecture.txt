GRIMM'S CONJECTURE: STRUCTURAL LEMMAS AND BOUNDED VERIFICATION

OPEN PROBLEM (1969): If n+1, n+2, ..., n+k are all composite, then there exist
distinct primes p_1, p_2, ..., p_k such that p_i | (n+i) for each i.

Equivalently: in any maximal gap between consecutive primes, the composite numbers
can be assigned distinct prime divisors.

This has been verified for all n up to 10^10. It is implied by (but weaker than)
the Cramér conjecture on prime gaps.

GOAL: Prove structural lemmas, bounded cases, and reductions.

STRATEGY 1: SMALL CASES
For k = 1: trivial. One composite number n+1 has a prime factor.
For k = 2: n+1, n+2 both composite. Need distinct primes p₁|(n+1), p₂|(n+2).
  If they share all prime factors, then gcd(n+1,n+2) > 1. But gcd(n+1,n+2) = 1. ✓
  So n+1 and n+2 always have distinct prime factors. Done for k=2.

For k = 3: n+1, n+2, n+3 all composite.
  By pigeonhole, need at least 3 primes dividing n+1, n+2, n+3.
  Since gcd(n+i, n+j) | (j-i), consecutive numbers share limited prime factors.
  Can prove by case analysis on parities and mod 3 residues.

STRATEGY 2: HALL'S MARRIAGE THEOREM CONNECTION
The conjecture is equivalent to: the bipartite graph G with
- Left vertices: {n+1, ..., n+k} (composite numbers)
- Right vertices: {primes}
- Edge (n+i, p) iff p | (n+i)
satisfies Hall's condition: for every subset S of left vertices,
|N(S)| ≥ |S| where N(S) = union of neighbors.

This is a matching theory problem! Hall's marriage theorem is in Mathlib.
The Grimm conjecture reduces to: for every set of k consecutive composites,
the set of their prime divisors has size ≥ k.

STRATEGY 3: PRIME COUNTING BOUND
If n+1,...,n+k are all composite, then π(n+k) - π(n) = 0 (no primes in range).
The number of distinct primes dividing ∏(n+1,...,n+k) is at least k
iff Grimm holds. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, each n+i has
at least one prime factor ≤ √(n+k). The number of primes ≤ √(n+k)
is about √(n+k)/ln(√(n+k)) by PNT.

For Grimm to fail, we'd need k > number of primes ≤ n+k dividing any of the composites.
Since k ≤ prime gap at n, and prime gaps are O(n^0.525), while the number of
primes ≤ n is ~n/ln(n), Grimm follows from strong enough prime gap bounds.

STRATEGY 4: BOUNDED VERIFICATION
Define check_grimm(n, k) that verifies distinct prime assignment exists for n+1,...,n+k.
Use Hall's condition or direct greedy assignment.

For native_decide: verify Grimm for all prime gaps up to some bound.
  def primes_up_to (N : ℕ) : List ℕ := (List.range (N+1)).filter Nat.Prime
  -- For each consecutive prime pair (p, q), verify Grimm for composites p+1,...,q-1.

STRATEGY 5: STRUCTURAL LEMMAS
1. grimm_k_eq_1: Trivially true (any composite has a prime factor)
2. grimm_k_eq_2: True by coprimality of consecutive integers
3. grimm_k_eq_3: True by case analysis on mod 6 residues
4. grimm_coprime: gcd(n+i, n+j) | |i-j| for distinct i, j
5. grimm_distinct_factors: k consecutive composites have ≥ k distinct prime factors
   (THIS is the key lemma equivalent to the full conjecture)
6. grimm_bounded: Verify for all prime gaps ≤ 1000 (or as high as native_decide allows)
7. grimm_from_bertrand: If Bertrand's postulate holds (prime in (n, 2n)), then
   prime gaps < n, so composites have plenty of distinct prime divisors

WHAT TO PROVE (any subset):
1. grimm_k1, grimm_k2, grimm_k3: Small cases
2. grimm_coprime_lemma: gcd(n+i, n+j) divides |i-j|
3. grimm_hall_reduction: Grimm ↔ Hall's condition on bipartite prime divisor graph
4. grimm_bounded_500: Grimm holds for all prime gaps below 500 via computation
5. grimm_from_gap_bound: If maximal prime gap below N is < f(N), then Grimm holds below N

This would be the first formalization of Grimm's conjecture structural results.
