Feit-Thompson p=3 Final Case: q ≡ 71 (mod 72) via Eisenstein Integer Arithmetic

PROBLEM STATUS: OPEN. This is the HARDEST remaining case of Feit-Thompson for p=3.

CONTEXT: The Feit-Thompson theorem states that every group of odd order is solvable. The original 1963 proof is 255 pages. A key step involves showing that for certain prime pairs (p,q) with p|q^p - 1, a contradiction arises. For p=3, we need 3 | q² + q + 1, so q ≡ 1 (mod 3), meaning q ≡ 2 (mod 3). Write A = (q³-1)/(q-1) = q² + q + 1.

We have proven ALL cases EXCEPT q ≡ 71 (mod 72) (equivalently q ≡ 7 mod 8 AND q ≡ 8 mod 9).

WHAT WE'VE PROVEN:
- q ≡ 1 (mod 4): Jacobi(3,A) = -1 contradicts 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ 1 (slot590, 437 lines)
- q ≡ 3 (mod 8): QR contradiction on (1-q) mod A (slot610, 365 lines)
- q ≡ 7 mod 8 with q ≢ 8 mod 9: Conditional on cubic character (slot611, 313 lines)
- Bounded: All q < 200,000 (slot603, 721 lines)

WHY THIS CASE IS HARD:
When q ≡ 71 mod 72: A = q²+q+1 ≡ 1 (mod 12). For ALL characters χ_d with d | 12 (QR, cubic, quartic), we get χ_d(3) = 1. The standard character-theory approach is exhausted.

PROPOSED APPROACH — Eisenstein Integer Arithmetic:
Instead of working in Z/AZ, work in Z[ω] where ω = e^{2πi/3}.

Key facts:
1. A = q² + q + 1 = (q - ω)(q - ω²) in Z[ω]. This is the norm of (q - ω).
2. The prime factorization of A in Z[ω]: since A ≡ 1 mod 3, A splits as π·π̄ where π = q - ω (up to units).
3. The Feit-Thompson condition gives us: 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ 1 (mod A), meaning ord_A(3) | (A-1)/2.
4. In Z[ω]: 3 = -ω²(1-ω)², and (1-ω) is a uniformizer at the prime 3 = (1-ω)² in Z[ω].

RESULT 1 — Eisenstein Factorization:
Theorem: If q is prime, q ≡ 2 (mod 3), then A = q²+q+1 factors in Z[ω] as A = N(q-ω) = (q-ω)(q-ω²). Moreover, this factorization yields gcd(q-ω, q-ω²) = 1 in Z[ω] (coprime Eisenstein integers).
Proof strategy: Direct computation. (q-ω)(q-ω²) = q² - q(ω+ω²) + ωω² = q² + q + 1. Coprimality: any common divisor divides (q-ω)-(q-ω²) = ω²-ω = ω²(1-ω), which has norm 3, but 3 ∤ A when q ≡ 2 mod 3.

RESULT 2 — Cubic Residue Symbol in Z[ω]:
Theorem: For q ≡ 71 mod 72, the cubic residue symbol [3/π]₃ = 1 where π = q - ω.
Proof strategy: By Eisenstein cubic reciprocity, [3/π]₃ · [π/3]₃⁻¹ = some explicit root of unity depending on norms. Since N(π) = A ≡ 1 mod 3 and N(3) = 9, compute explicitly. The fact that q ≡ 8 mod 9 means q³ ≡ q mod 9, so the cubic residue symbol evaluates to 1.

RESULT 3 — Order Constraint from Eisenstein Norm:
Theorem: If 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ 1 (mod A), then writing A = π·π̄ in Z[ω], we get 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ 1 (mod π) and 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ 1 (mod π̄). The order of 3 modulo π divides (A-1)/2 = (q²+q)/2.
Proof strategy: Standard lift from Z to Z[ω]. Since π | A in Z[ω], the congruence mod A implies congruence mod π. The order divides the exponent.

RESULT 4 — Sextic Residue Analysis:
Theorem: For q ≡ 71 mod 72, the sextic residue symbol [3/π]₆ satisfies [3/π]₆ = [3/π]₃ · [3/π]₂ where [3/π]₂ is the QR symbol. Since A ≡ 1 mod 12, both the quadratic and cubic symbols equal 1, so the sextic symbol equals 1.
However, the 12th power residue symbol can be non-trivial. The key observation: A ≡ 1 mod 12 but A might not be ≡ 1 mod 24. If v₂(A-1) is exactly 2 (i.e., A ≡ 5 mod 8... wait, A = q²+q+1, q ≡ 7 mod 8: A = 49+7+1 = 57, 57 mod 8 = 1). So A ≡ 1 mod 8 always.

Actually: A ≡ 1 mod 24 when q ≡ 71 mod 72. So 24 | A-1. The 24th power residue is the right level.

RESULT 5 — Bounded Verification Extension:
Theorem: There are no Feit-Thompson counterexamples with p=3 and q ≡ 71 (mod 72) for q < 10^6.
Proof strategy: For each prime q ≡ 71 mod 72 up to 10^6, compute A = q²+q+1 and check whether ord_A(3) | (A-1)/2. The answer is always NO (ord_A(3) does not divide (A-1)/2, or equivalently ord_A(3) divides A-1 but not (A-1)/2, giving 3^{(A-1)/2} ≡ -1 mod A, contradicting the FT hypothesis). Use native_decide or computation.

RESULT 6 — Structure of ord_A(3):
Theorem: For q prime, q ≡ 71 mod 72, let A = q²+q+1. Then:
(a) q | ord_A(3) (i.e., the multiplicative order of 3 mod A is divisible by q)
(b) 3^q ≢ 1 (mod A)
(c) 3^{q(q+1)/2} ≡ 1 (mod A) but 3^{(q+1)/2} ≢ 1 (mod A)
Proof strategy: (a) follows from the fact that 3 generates a large subgroup mod A. Verified computationally for all q < 200,000 (slot603). (b) If 3^q ≡ 1 mod A, then since A = q²+q+1 and q² ≡ 1 mod (q²+q+1) when... actually 3^q ≡ 1 mod A iff q | ord_A(3) | q, i.e., ord_A(3) = q. But ord_A(3) | φ(A) and q | A-1 = q(q+1), so q | φ(A) is possible. The point is 3^q ≢ 1 empirically.

Please prove as many of these results as possible. Results 1, 3, and 5 should be most tractable. Result 1 is pure Eisenstein integer arithmetic. Result 5 extends our bounded verification. Results 2 and 4 involve cubic/sextic residue theory which is in Mathlib (ZMod, IsCoprime, orderOf). Even partial progress on Result 6 would be valuable — proving q | ord_A(3) unconditionally would be a genuine contribution.
