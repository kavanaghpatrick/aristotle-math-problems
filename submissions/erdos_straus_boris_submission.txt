# Erdős-Straus Conjecture - Boris Pattern Submission

## Goal
Prove the Erdős-Straus conjecture for all positive integers n ≥ 2:
Every positive integer n ≥ 2 can be expressed as 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z
for some positive integers x, y, z.

## You Decide
- Which proof strategy to use (modular arithmetic, case analysis, etc.)
- Which lemmas to create
- How to structure the formalization
- Which intermediate theorems to prove

## Mathematical Background
- Conjecture formulated by Paul Erdős and Ernst G. Straus (1948)
- Verified computationally for n ≤ 10^17 (Salez, 2014)
- Known to hold when n ≡ 0 (mod 4) or n ≡ 2 (mod 3) or n ≡ 3 (mod 4)
- Only unresolved residue classes modulo 840: {1, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529}

## Key Constraint
The equation 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z must have a solution in positive integers
x, y, z for EVERY positive integer n ≥ 2.

## Equivalent Formulation
For all n ≥ 2, there exist positive integers x, y, z such that:
4xyz = n(yz + xz + xy)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Formal proof in Lean 4
- ✅ Zero sorries
- ✅ Compiles without errors
- ✅ Covers all positive integers n ≥ 2
