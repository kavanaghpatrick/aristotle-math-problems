## Detailed Paper Notes

### Parker 2406.06501 (2025) - PRIMARY REFERENCE ✅

**Citation**: Parker, A. "New bounds on a generalization of Tuza's conjecture." arXiv:2406.06501, EJC May 2025.

**We Read**: Full paper via arXiv

**Key Results**:
1. Proves Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture for ν^(k-1) ≤ 3 in k-uniform hypergraphs
2. For graphs (k=3): Tuza holds when ν ≤ 3
3. T_e/S_e decomposition technique

**Proof Technique**:
- Define T_e = triangles sharing edge with packing element e
- Define S_e = triangles in T_e not sharing edge with other packing elements
- Show τ(T_e) ≤ 2 for some e when ν ≤ 3
- Induction: τ(G) ≤ τ(T_e) + τ(G \ T_e) ≤ 2 + 2(ν-1) = 2ν

**Why It Fails at ν=4**:
- With M = {e, f₁, f₂, f₃}, bridges can attach to all 3 fᵢ
- Cannot guarantee τ(T_e) ≤ 2 for any e

**Our Formalization**: Matches exactly. See proven/tuza/lemmas/parker_lemmas.lean

### Guruswami-Sandeep 2025 📖

**Citation**: Guruswami, V., Sandeep, S. "Approximate Hypergraph Vertex Cover and Generalized Tuza's Conjecture." SIAM J. Discrete Math. 39(2):1312-1334, 2025.

**We Read**: Abstract and key results

**Key Results**:
1. t/2 + O(√t log t) approximation for fractional Aharoni-Zerbib via LP rounding
2. **Negative result**: Tent-free (and F-free) hypergraphs can require covering almost all vertices
3. Greedy achieves (ln n)/2 for set cover on simple hypergraphs

**Implications for ν=4**:
- LP rounding techniques available
- Duality gap approach to Tuza is blocked (their negative result)
- Must use structural properties, not just LP relaxation

**Need to Read**: Full proof technique details

### Dense Graphs 2405.11409 (2024) 📖

**Citation**: "On Tuza's Conjecture in Dense Graphs." arXiv:2405.11409, 2024.

**We Read**: Abstract and main theorem

**Key Results**:
1. τ ≤ (3/2)ν for complete 4-partite graphs (this is OPTIMAL - tight examples exist)
2. Dense graphs satisfy Tuza with better constants

**Implications for ν=4**:
- If a ν=4 graph is "bad" (τ(T_e) ≥ 3 for all e), it must be dense
- Dense graphs have BETTER bounds, not worse
- "Bad" graphs resemble 4-partite → may get τ ≤ 6 instead of τ ≤ 8

**Need to Read**: Proof technique, tight examples

---

### Haxell 1999 (66/23 Bound) 📖

**Citation**: Haxell, P.E. "Packing and covering triangles in graphs." Discrete Math. 195(1):251-254, 1999.

**Status**: Key results extracted from search

**Main Theorem**:
If G is a graph with ν(G) = maximum edge-disjoint triangles, then there exists a set C of edges with |C| ≤ (3 - ε)ν(G) where **ε > 3/23**, such that every triangle contains an edge from C.

**The 66/23 Bound**:
- Since ε > 3/23, we get τ ≤ (3 - 3/23)ν = (66/23)ν ≈ 2.87ν
- This was the **first nontrivial bound** for general graphs

**Why No Improvement Since 1999**:
- 26 years with no progress on general bound
- Baron-Kahn (2016) showed Tuza is asymptotically TIGHT for dense graphs
- Any improvement would require new techniques

**Key Insight for ν=4**:
- 66/23 ≈ 2.87, so for ν=4: τ ≤ 11.48
- Tuza claims τ ≤ 8 (gap of ~3.48 edges)
- Our approach via small ν is orthogonal to improving general bound

**Related Results (Haxell)**:
- 1993: Tripartite graphs satisfy Tuza exactly
- 1998 (with Kohayakawa): Tripartite techniques
- 2001 (with Rödl): Fractional packings in dense graphs
- 2012 (with Kostochka, Thomassé): K₄-free planar → τ ≤ (3/2)ν

### Krivelevich 1995 (Fractional) 📖

**Citation**: Krivelevich, M. "On a conjecture of Tuza about packing and covering of triangles." Discrete Math. 142:281-286, 1995.

**Status**: Key results extracted from search

**Key Results**:
1. **τ* = ν* (fractional versions are equal)** - By LP duality
2. **τ ≤ 2ν for K₃,₃-free graphs** - Graphs with no K₃,₃ subdivision
3. **τ ≤ 2ν* (mixed bound)** - Integer cover ≤ 2 × fractional packing

**Proof Technique**:
- LP formulation: fractional matching/transversal duality
- τ*(H) = ν*(H) always (LP strong duality)
- τ(H) ≥ τ*(H) = ν*(H) ≥ ν(H) (integer ≥ fractional)

**Key Insight for ν=4**:
- The real question is bounding the integrality gap
- τ ≤ 2ν is equivalent to τ/ν* ≤ 2 (since τ* = ν*)
- Need to show fractional solution can be rounded to ≤ 2× integer

**Why Important**:
- Fractional equality is key insight
- Proves integrality gap ≤ 2 is the real question
- Yuster built on this for asymptotic dense graphs result

### Aharoni-Zerbib 2020 (Hypergraph Generalization) 📖

**Citation**: Aharoni, R., Zerbib, S. "A generalization of Tuza's conjecture." J. Graph Theory 94(3):445-462, 2020.

**We Read**: Abstract and conjecture statement

**The Generalization**:
For k-uniform hypergraph H:
- ν^(m)(H) = max edges with pairwise intersection < m
- τ^(m)(H) = min m-sets hitting all edges
- **Conjecture**: τ^(k-1)(H) ≤ ⌈(k+1)/2⌉ · ν^(k-1)(H)

For k=3 (graphs): This is exactly Tuza's conjecture (τ ≤ 2ν)

**Why Important**:
- Parker proved this for ν^(k-1) ≤ 3
- Framework for understanding higher-dimensional structure

---

### Treewidth Paper 2002.07925 (2020) 📖

**Citation**: Botler, F., et al. "On Tuza's conjecture for triangulations and graphs with small treewidth." arXiv:2002.07925, 2020.

**We Read**: Abstract and main results

**Key Results**:
1. **Tuza holds for treewidth ≤ 6** - Tree decomposition approach
2. **Planar triangulations (G ≠ K₄): τ ≤ (3/2)ν** - Improved bound
3. **Maximal treewidth-3 graphs: τ ≤ (9/5)ν + 1/5** - Even better

**Connection to Prior Work**:
- Strengthens Tuza's result that τ ≤ 2ν for K₈-free chordal graphs
- Chordal graphs have bounded treewidth

**Proof Technique**:
- Tree decomposition + structural analysis
- Likely uses reducibility (substructures that can't appear in minimal counterexample)

**Key Insight for ν=4**:
- Bounded treewidth gives Tuza, but ν=4 graphs may have unbounded treewidth
- The treewidth-6 result shows LOCAL structure can force Tuza
- Could we show ν=4 graphs have "local" bounded structure?

---

### Baron-Kahn 2016 (Asymptotic Tightness) 📖

**Citation**: Baron, J.D., Kahn, J. "Tuza's Conjecture is Asymptotically Tight for Dense Graphs." Combin. Probab. Comput. 25:645-667, 2016. [arXiv:1408.4870](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4870)

**We Read**: Abstract and main result

**Main Result** (Disproves Yuster's Conjecture):
For any fixed positive α, there exist arbitrarily large graphs G of positive density satisfying:
- τ₃(G) > (1 - o(1))|E(G)|/2
- ν₃(G) < (1 + α)|E(G)|/4

**What This Means**:
- The ratio τ/ν can approach 2 asymptotically for dense graphs
- Tuza's bound τ ≤ 2ν is TIGHT (can't be improved to τ ≤ (2-ε)ν)
- Counterexamples to τ < 2ν exist in the dense regime

**Construction Technique**:
- Partly random construction
- Produces graphs where τ approaches |E|/2
- While ν approaches |E|/4
- Ratio approaches 2

**Key Insight for ν=4**:
- **This is GOOD news for us!** Dense graphs approach the limit τ = 2ν
- If a ν=4 graph were a counterexample, it would need τ ≥ 9
- But dense ν=4 graphs have τ close to 8 (the limit)
- Counterexamples (if any) must be SPARSE and structured

### Threshold Graphs 2105.09871 (2021) 📖

**Citation**: Bożyk, Ł., et al. "Tuza's Conjecture for Threshold Graphs." arXiv:2105.09871, 2021.

**We Read**: Abstract

**Key Result**: Tuza holds for threshold graphs (graphs that are both split and cographs)

**Why Important**:
- Split graphs generally still OPEN
- Shows structural approach works for restricted classes

## Key Lemmas That Could Help ν=4

### From LP Theory (Krivelevich)
```
Lemma: τ*(G) = ν*(G) for all graphs G
Proof: LP duality
Implication: Need to bound integrality gap for ν=4 graphs
```

### From Dense Graphs (Baron-Kahn + 2405.11409)
```
Lemma: For complete 4-partite graphs, τ ≤ (3/2)ν
Implication: If ν=4 counterexample exists, it's NOT dense/multipartite
```

### From Treewidth (2002.07925)
```
Theorem: treewidth(G) ≤ 6 implies τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G)
Implication: ν=4 counterexample must have treewidth ≥ 7
```

### From Reducibility (Puleo)
```
Concept: Identify configurations that can be "reduced" in minimal counterexample
Application: Could enumerate reducible configs for ν=4 specifically
```

### From Parker (Our Formalization)
```
Lemma: S_e triangles pairwise share edges → τ(S_e) ≤ 2
Lemma: ν(G \ T_e) = ν(G) - 1
Lemma: τ(G) ≤ τ(T_e) + τ(G \ T_e)
Gap: Need τ(T_e) ≤ 4 for ν=4, but bridges can force τ(T_e) ≥ 3
```

## Synthesis: What Literature Tells Us About ν=4

### What We Know
1. **LP perspective**: τ* = ν* = 4, so τ ≤ 8 iff integrality gap ≤ 2
2. **Dense graphs are good**: Complete 4-partite has τ ≤ 6 < 8
3. **Sparse graphs are good**: Treewidth ≤ 6 works, random graphs work
4. **Counterexamples are structured**: Not random, not too dense, not too sparse

### What We Don't Know
1. **Exact Haxell technique** - could adapt for ν=4?
2. **Reducible set enumeration** - which configs are reducible at ν=4?
3. **Bridge attachment limits** - how many packing elements can a bridge touch?

### Our Unique Contribution
- **Only Lean 4 formalization** of Tuza for small ν
- **Full Parker proof formalized** for ν ≤ 3
- **Counterexamples** ruling out naive strategies
- **ν=4 is genuinely open** - first to attempt formal proof

---

## Open Questions from Literature

1. **General chordal graphs** - K8-free proven, general open
2. **Split graphs** - Only dense case proven
3. **Interval graphs** - Only co-chain subclass proven
4. **Improve 66/23 bound** - No progress since 1999
5. **ν = 4 case** - No published proof (OUR TARGET)
