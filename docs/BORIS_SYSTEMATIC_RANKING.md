# Boris Pattern Systematic Ranking

Generated by automated extraction from 261 FC Lean files.

## Scoring Formula
- +10 per `@[category research solved]`
- +5 per `@[category undergraduate]`
- +5 per `@[category test]`
- +5 if `by decide` or `by native` present
- +3 if graph theory keywords
- -5 if asymptotics (atTop, Tendsto, liminf, etc.)
- -3 if prize >= $500

## Key Insight

**47% of problems use asymptotics** - these should be avoided for Aristotle.

**52% have SOLVED variants** - massive opportunity!

The intersection of "has SOLVED variants" AND "no asymptotics" is our sweet spot:
~40 problems that are both tractable AND have known results.
