Extend the Jones Polynomial Formalization to Four Additional Knots (6₁, 6₂, 6₃, 7₁)

CONTEXT:
You previously created a Lean 4 formalization of the Jones polynomial for knots 3₁, 4₁, 5₁, 5₂ (project UUID: 2e358cc4-caf3-4e75-846d-60da35fb9b1e). That proof computed the Kauffman bracket using planar diagram (PD) codes and verified Jones polynomials against known values using native_decide.

GOAL:
Extend this formalization to verify the Jones polynomial for four additional knots:
- 6₁ (Stevedore's knot)
- 6₂ (Miller Institute knot)
- 6₃ (Eskimo bowline)
- 7₁ (Septafoil knot)

SPECIFIC TASKS:

1. **Define Knot Diagrams from PD Codes**:

Use the following verified PD codes from Knot Atlas (https://katlas.org):

**Knot 6₁ (Stevedore)**:
- PD Code: X1425 X7,10,8,11 X3948 X9,3,10,2 X5,12,6,1 X11,6,12,7
- Expected Jones polynomial V(q): q² - q + 2 - 2q⁻¹ + q⁻² - q⁻³ + q⁻⁴
- Variable conversion (q → t⁻¹): t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - 2t⁻¹ + 2 - t + t²
- Reversible symmetry, 6 crossings

**Knot 6₂ (Miller Institute)**:
- PD Code: X1425 X5,10,6,11 X3948 X9,3,10,2 X7,12,8,1 X11,6,12,7
- Expected Jones polynomial V(q): q - 1 + 2q⁻¹ - 2q⁻² + 2q⁻³ - 2q⁻⁴ + q⁻⁵
- Variable conversion (q → t⁻¹): t⁻⁵ - 2t⁻⁴ + 2t⁻³ - 2t⁻² + 2t⁻¹ - 1 + t
- Reversible symmetry, 6 crossings

**Knot 6₃ (Eskimo Bowline)**:
- PD Code: X4251 X8493 X12,9,1,10 X10,5,11,6 X6,11,7,12 X2837
- Expected Jones polynomial V(q): −q³ + 2q² − 2q + 3 − 2q⁻¹ + 2q⁻² − q⁻³
- Variable conversion (q → t⁻¹): −t⁻³ + 2t⁻² − 2t⁻¹ + 3 − 2t + 2t² − t³
- Full amphicheirality (symmetric), 6 crossings, signature 0

**Knot 7₁ (Septafoil)**:
- PD Code: X1829 X3,10,4,11 X5,12,6,13 X7,14,8,1 X9,2,10,3 X11,4,12,5 X13,6,14,7
- Expected Jones polynomial V(q): −q⁻¹⁰ + q⁻⁹ − q⁻⁸ + q⁻⁷ − q⁻⁶ + q⁻⁵ + q⁻³
- Variable conversion (q → t⁻¹): −t¹⁰ + t⁹ − t⁸ + t⁷ − t⁶ + t⁵ + t³
- Reversible symmetry, 7 crossings

2. **Convert PD Codes to Lean 4 LinkDiagram Format**:

Follow the established pattern from your previous work:
- Each crossing "Xa,b,c,d" becomes a Crossing structure with (s1, s2, s3, s4) = (a, b, c, d)
- Determine crossing signs:
  - For torus knots (7₁ is (7,2)-torus): typically all same sign
  - For alternating knots: alternating ±1
  - Use the pattern that produced correct polynomials in your previous work
  - CRITICAL: Verify crossing signs produce the expected writhe

3. **Compute Kauffman Bracket**:

Use your existing kauffman_bracket_computable_v4 function:
- Input: LinkDiagram with PD code converted to crossings
- Output: Laurent polynomial in variable A

Expected complexity (from your previous analysis):
- 6 crossings: 2^7 - 1 = 127 recursive steps (should satisfy ≤ 6³ = 216)
- 7 crossings: 2^8 - 1 = 255 recursive steps (should satisfy ≤ 7³ = 343)

4. **Compute Jones Polynomial**:

Apply the normalization: V(t) = (-A³)⁻ʷ⁽ᴸ⁾ · <L>
where:
- w(L) is the writhe (sum of crossing signs)
- <L> is the Kauffman bracket
- Variable relation: t = A⁻⁴

5. **Verify Against Expected Values**:

For each knot, prove using native_decide:
```lean
theorem jones_6_1_correct :
  jones_polynomial_computable_v4 knot_6_1 = p6_1_target := by native_decide

theorem jones_6_2_correct :
  jones_polynomial_computable_v4 knot_6_2 = p6_2_target := by native_decide

theorem jones_6_3_correct :
  jones_polynomial_computable_v4 knot_6_3 = p6_3_target := by native_decide

theorem jones_7_1_correct :
  jones_polynomial_computable_v4 knot_7_1 = p7_1_target := by native_decide
```

6. **Prove Complexity Bounds**:

For each knot, prove:
```lean
theorem knot_6_1_complexity : bracket_complexity knot_6_1 ≤ 216 := by native_decide
theorem knot_6_2_complexity : bracket_complexity knot_6_2 ≤ 216 := by native_decide
theorem knot_6_3_complexity : bracket_complexity knot_6_3 ≤ 216 := by native_decide
theorem knot_7_1_complexity : bracket_complexity knot_7_1 ≤ 343 := by native_decide
```

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:

1. **Build on Existing Work**: Import and extend the definitions from your previous Jones polynomial formalization. Do NOT redefine the Kauffman bracket or Jones polynomial from scratch.

2. **Crossing Sign Determination**: This is CRITICAL. In your previous work, one knot (5₂) had incorrect crossing signs. For these new knots:
   - Start with the standard PD code interpretation
   - If verification fails, try different sign combinations
   - Use the all_sign_combinations search approach from your previous work ONLY if needed
   - Document which sign pattern works for each knot

3. **Variable Convention**: Maintain t = A⁻⁴ convention. Knot Atlas uses variable q, which equals t⁻¹ in your convention.

4. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Define expected polynomial as SparsePoly (list of (exponent, coefficient) pairs)
   - Use #eval to test equality before proving
   - Prove with native_decide once #eval succeeds

5. **Output Structure**: Produce a complete, self-contained Lean 4 file that:
   - Imports necessary Mathlib modules
   - Defines all 4 knot diagrams
   - Defines all 4 target Jones polynomials
   - Proves 4 verification theorems
   - Proves 4 complexity bound theorems
   - Total expected length: 300-500 lines

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 4 Jones polynomials verified via native_decide
- All 4 complexity bounds proven
- No sorry statements
- No opaque definitions
- Code compiles and all proofs check in Lean 4.24.0

EXPECTED TIMELINE: 2-4 hours

NOTE: The knot 7₁ (septafoil) is the (7,2)-torus knot, similar to how 3₁ (trefoil) is (3,2) and 5₁ (cinquefoil) is (5,2). Use the pattern from those successful verifications as a guide.
