# SAT-Based Knot Invariant Verification with LRAT Proofs

## The Goal

Create a **publication-ready SAT-based verification system for knot invariants** with formally verified LRAT proof certificates.

We want this publishable at FMCAD/CAV 2026 or similar verification conferences.

## What We Need From You

**Build a complete SAT-based verification system for knot invariants with formal LRAT proof checking in Lean 4.**

You decide:
- How to encode knot invariants as SAT constraints
- Which knot invariants to verify (Jones polynomial? Unknot detection? HOMFLY-PT?)
- How to structure the LRAT proof certificate format
- What theorems to prove about the verification pipeline
- How to balance completeness vs. feasibility

## Why SAT + LRAT?

**SAT solvers** are battle-tested for exhaustive verification of complex constraints.
**LRAT certificates** provide verifiable proof traces that can be checked in Lean 4.

**Key advantage**: Separates search (SAT solver does computation) from verification (Lean checks certificate).

This is certificate-based verification - similar to successful projects like Spectral Gap proofs.

## What We Know Works

**From Jones Polynomial success** (269 lines, 0 sorries):
- Computational verification has value
- Simple, focused tasks succeed
- Native computation via `native_decide` works well

**From Spectral Gap success** (860 lines, 0 sorries):
- Certificate-based verification scales
- Concrete specifications work
- External computation + Lean verification is powerful

**From HOMFLY-PT challenges**:
- Don't ask Lean to compute complex algebra directly
- Use external tools for computation, Lean for verification
- Certificate-based approaches avoid implementation bugs

## Guidance (Not Requirements)

**Typical SAT-based verification pipeline**:
1. Encode problem as CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)
2. Run SAT solver to get solution + proof trace
3. Convert proof trace to LRAT format
4. Verify LRAT certificate in Lean 4
5. Extract verified result

**Typical theorems to prove**:
- LRAT certificate checker is sound
- Encoding correctly represents the problem
- Verified results are mathematically correct
- Pipeline preserves correctness end-to-end

**But YOU decide** what's actually needed for publication!

## Example Use Cases (You Choose Scope)

**Easy (proof of concept)**:
- Unknot detection for small knots (3-7 crossings)
- Jones polynomial computation for simple braids
- Verification via SAT that two knots are distinct

**Medium (publication-worthy)**:
- Jones polynomial verification for 10+ knots
- Unknot detection with formal correctness proofs
- LRAT certificate checking with soundness theorems

**Ambitious (stretch goal)**:
- HOMFLY-PT polynomial via SAT encoding
- Reidemeister move verification
- General knot invariant computation framework

**You decide** what's achievable and publication-worthy!

## Technical Context

**SAT/LRAT Background**:
- CNF: Conjunctive Normal Form (AND of ORs)
- LRAT: Linear Resolution Asymmetric Tautology
- Common format: DIMACS CNF for input, DRAT/LRAT for proofs

**Existing Lean 4 work**:
- Mathlib has basic SAT/CNF definitions
- LRAT checkers exist in other proof assistants (Isabelle, Coq)
- You may need to implement LRAT checker or use existing work

**Knot theory encoding**:
- Braid words as sequences of generators
- Crossings as boolean constraints
- Polynomial coefficients as arithmetic constraints

## What Success Looks Like

**Minimum viable**:
- ✅ Working SAT encoding for at least one knot invariant
- ✅ LRAT certificate verification in Lean 4
- ✅ Some formal correctness proofs
- ✅ Demonstration on 3-5 example knots

**Target (publishable)**:
- ✅ Complete SAT-based verification pipeline
- ✅ LRAT certificate checker with soundness proof
- ✅ Verified results for 10+ knots
- ✅ End-to-end correctness theorems
- ✅ Minimal sorries (ideally 0)

**Stretch**:
- ✅ Multiple knot invariants supported
- ✅ General framework for SAT-based topology verification
- ✅ Comparison to direct computation approaches
- ✅ Performance analysis and scalability results

## The Philosophy

**Certificate-based verification**: Let external tools (SAT solvers) do heavy computation. Lean verifies the result is correct.

**Separation of concerns**:
- SAT solver: Search for solutions (untrusted)
- LRAT certificate: Proof trace (verifiable artifact)
- Lean checker: Verification (trusted)

**Trade-off decision**: You make editorial choices about scope, completeness, and what to highlight for publication.

## Output Format

**Lean 4 file(s)** with:
- SAT encoding definitions
- LRAT certificate format and checker
- Formal correctness proofs
- Example verifications (concrete knots)
- Clear documentation
- Minimal sorries (ideally 0)

---

**In short**: Build a publication-ready SAT-based knot verification system with LRAT proofs. You're the expert on what that means!
