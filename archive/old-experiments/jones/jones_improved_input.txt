## Problem Statement: Jones Polynomial Computational Complexity for Specific Knots

Prove tight computational complexity bounds for computing the Jones polynomial V_K(t) via skein relations for specific low-crossing knots.

---

## Background

The Jones polynomial V_K(t) is a knot invariant satisfying the **skein relation**:

  t^(-1) * V_L+ - t * V_L- = (t^(1/2) - t^(-1/2)) * V_L0

where L+, L-, and L0 are three link diagrams differing at exactly one crossing:
- L+: positive crossing
- L-: negative crossing
- L0: smoothed crossing (no crossing)

The base cases are:
- V_unknot(t) = 1
- V_unlink_n(t) = (-t^(1/2) - t^(-1/2))^(n-1)

## Target Knots (Concrete Instances)

We focus on **alternating knots with crossing number c ≤ 5**:

1. **Trefoil knot (3_1)**:
   - Crossing number: c = 3
   - Known result: V_{3_1}(t) = t + t^3 - t^4

2. **Figure-eight knot (4_1)**:
   - Crossing number: c = 4
   - Known result: V_{4_1}(t) = -t^(-2) + 1 - t^2 + t^4 - t^6

3. **Cinquefoil knot (5_1)**:
   - Crossing number: c = 5
   - Known result: V_{5_1}(t) = t^2 + t^6 - t^8 + t^10 - t^12

4. **Three-twist knot (5_2)**:
   - Crossing number: c = 5
   - Known result: V_{5_2}(t) = t^(-2) - t^(-1) + 1 - t + 2*t^2 - t^3 + t^4 - t^5 + t^6

## Goal 1: Upper Bound (Algorithmic)

**Prove**: Computing V_K(t) for a knot K with crossing number c via the skein relation requires **at most O(c^3) skein relation applications**.

**Approach**:
1. Each crossing can be resolved in 3 ways (L+, L-, L0)
2. Skein tree has at most 3^c leaves (worst case)
3. With memoization, revisited diagrams cost O(1)
4. Total diagrams with c crossings: at most O(2^c) planar graphs
5. Prove that with optimal traversal strategy, complexity is O(c^3)

**Concrete targets**:
- Trefoil (c=3): at most 27 skein applications
- Figure-eight (c=4): at most 64 skein applications
- Cinquefoil (c=5): at most 125 skein applications

---

## Goal 2: Lower Bound (Hardness)

**Prove**: Computing V_K(t) for any non-trivial knot K with crossing number c requires **at least Ω(c) skein relation applications**.

**Approach**:
1. Show that each crossing must be resolved at least once
2. Prove no shortcut exists that avoids analyzing crossing structure
3. Use alternating knot properties to show irreducibility

**Concrete targets**:
- Any knot with c crossings: at least c skein applications needed
- Alternating knots: at least c/2 independent crossing resolutions

---

## Goal 3: Specific Verification (Computational)

**Prove**: For the four target knots, verify via direct skein relation computation that:

1. V_{3_1}(t) = t + t^3 - t^4 (trefoil)
2. V_{4_1}(t) = -t^(-2) + 1 - t^2 + t^4 - t^6 (figure-eight)
3. V_{5_1}(t) = t^2 + t^6 - t^8 + t^10 - t^12 (cinquefoil)
4. V_{5_2}(t) = t^(-2) - t^(-1) + 1 - t + 2*t^2 - t^3 + t^4 - t^5 + t^6 (three-twist)

**Method**: Use `native_decide` or computational tactics to verify polynomial equality.

---

## Goal 4: Evaluation at Roots of Unity

**Prove**: For t = e^(2πi/5) (5th root of unity), computing V_K(t) for the target knots can be done in polynomial time.

**Approach**:
1. At roots of unity, Laurent polynomials become finite cyclotomic polynomials
2. Show that t^5 = 1 reduces polynomial degree significantly
3. Prove evaluation complexity is O(c^2) for alternating knots at t = e^(2πi/k)

---

## Formalization Requirements

1. **Knot Representation**: Use planar diagram encoding (crossings as signed vertices)
2. **Skein Relation**: Define recursive function applying skein relation
3. **Complexity Model**: Count skein relation applications as unit cost
4. **Laurent Polynomials**: Use Mathlib's polynomial library extended to negative exponents
5. **Verification**: Use `native_decide` for concrete polynomial equality

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Concrete instances**: Specific knots, not abstract types
✅ **Quantitative bounds**: O(c^3) upper, Ω(c) lower
✅ **Verifiable claims**: Known Jones polynomials verified computationally
✅ **Target length**: 150-300 lines of Lean proof
✅ **Non-trivial content**: Real bounds, not just framework

---

## Expected Output

A Lean 4 file containing:
1. Definitions of planar diagrams and skein relations
2. Formalization of the four target knots (3_1, 4_1, 5_1, 5_2)
3. Theorems proving upper bound O(c^3) and lower bound Ω(c)
4. Computational verification of known Jones polynomials
5. Analysis of complexity at roots of unity

Target: **150-300 lines** of substantive proof (not just type definitions).

## Notes

- This problem is **genuinely tractable** because:
  - Crossing numbers are small (c ≤ 5)
  - Jones polynomials are known (verification problem)
  - Skein relation is constructive and well-defined

- This avoids the **#P-hardness trap** because:
  - We're analyzing specific instances, not general algorithm
  - Upper/lower bounds are asymptotic, not exact characterization
  - Focus is on provable complexity, not deciding polynomial-time

- **Comparison to HQC v2** (which succeeded):
  - HQC: Concrete parameters (n=17669, t=66), proved ≥ 2^100
  - Jones: Concrete knots (c ≤ 5), prove O(c^3) and Ω(c)
  - Both: Quantitative bounds on specific instances
