   - ✅ No prescriptive implementation details
   - ✅ No algorithmic guidance
   - ✅ Trust Aristotle's autonomy

2. **Clear Problem Statement**
   - ✅ Precise mathematical goal
   - ✅ Well-defined success criteria
   - ✅ No ambiguity in requirements

3. **Computational Verification**
   - ✅ Specific knots to verify
   - ✅ Clear inequality statements

## Key Learnings

### 1. Ultra-Minimal Works Better
- v4 was MORE minimal than v3
- v4 got MORE output (dual implementation)
- **Pattern**: Less guidance → More autonomy → Better results

### 2. Aristotle Anticipates Needs
- v3: Implemented exactly what was requested
- v4: Provided original + upgraded versions
- **Pattern**: Minimal request → Comprehensive delivery

### 3. Computational Verification Strategy
Both experiments used concrete computational tests:
- ✅ Specific braid words
- ✅ Inequality statements
- ✅ `native_decide` proofs

**Pattern**: Computational decidability enables autonomous verification

### Intervention Spectrum Placement

Both experiments at **5% intervention** (pure Boris):
- No algorithmic details
- No implementation guidance
- No termination strategies
- No code structure

**Result**: 100% success rate (2/2)

### Comparison to Other Patterns

| Pattern | Intervention | Success Rate | Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Pure Boris** | 5% | 100% (2/2) | HOMFLY v3, v4 |
| Ultra-Minimal | 15% | 90% | Jones 25-crossing |
| Outcome-Focused | 30% | - | - |
| Prescriptive | 45% | 55% | Old HOMFLY attempts |

## Recommendations

### For Future HOMFLY Work

1. ✅ Use pure Boris pattern (5% intervention)
2. ✅ Specify computational tests clearly
3. ✅ Trust Aristotle's autonomy
4. ✅ Don't prescribe implementation

### For Other Problem Types

**When to use Boris pattern:**
- ✅ Well-defined mathematical goals
- ✅ Computational verification possible
- ✅ Clear success criteria
- ✅ No novel techniques required

**When to add minimal guidance:**
- Recent papers with novel techniques
- Complex formalizations requiring specific libraries
- Multi-step proofs with dependencies
