      "content": "You are an expert in Lean 4 theorem proving and combinatorics. I need your help preparing resubmission strategies for Aristotle (an AI theorem prover).\n\n## Context\nAristotle timed out on several problems but made substantial partial progress. I need to:\n1. Identify what was achieved\n2. Identify what's missing\n3. Design a resubmission strategy that builds on the progress\n\n## Problem 1: Erdős #23 (3 parallel approaches)\n\n**The Problem**: Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges.\n\n**Option C (dbd91222) - Structural approach - MOST PROMISING**:\n- ACHIEVED: Proved `erdos_problem_23_C5_colorable` - any C5-colorable graph can be made bipartite by ≤n² edges\n- ACHIEVED: Proved `min_prod_le_sq`, `pathGraph_bipartite`, `cycleGraph_five_delete_edge_bipartite`\n- MISSING: 2 `exact?` holes in `bipartite_of_hom` and `bipartite_pullback_deletion`\n- GAP: Need to prove ALL triangle-free graphs are C5-colorable (or handle non-C5-colorable case)\n\n**Option B (4cdc2339) - Quantitative bounds**:\n- ACHIEVED: Erdos23Bound 3.125, 2.4, 1.5625\n- ACHIEVED: Mantel's theorem, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality application\n- MISSING: Several `exact?` holes\n- GAP: Need to reach bound 1.0 (or prove 1.0 is optimal)\n\n**General (b2749da7) - C5 blow-up theory**:\n- ACHIEVED: C5_blowup definition, is_triangle_free, bound (n²), tightness\n- ACHIEVED: subgraph_of_C5_blowup_bound_general\n- MISSING: Several `exact?` holes in final theorems\n- GAP: Need to connect C5 blow-up to general triangle-free graphs\n\n## Problem 2: Tuza's Conjecture (efee5ffd)\n\n**The Problem**: τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G) where τ = min edge cover, ν = max edge-disjoint triangle packing\n\n**Achieved**:\n- Defined `trianglePackingNumber` and `triangleCoveringNumber`\n- Proved `tuza_base_case` (ν=0 → τ=0)\n- Proved `tuza_case_nu_1` (ν=1 → τ≤2) - substantial work!\n- Proved `tuza_conjecture_of_inductive_step` - if we can always reduce ν by removing ≤2 edges, the conjecture holds\n\n**Missing**:\n- The key inductive step lemma\n- Several `exact?` holes in supporting lemmas\n\n## Task\n\nFor each problem, provide:\n1. **Diagnosis**: What's the critical gap between current progress and full solution?\n2. **Resubmission Strategy**: How should we frame the resubmission to maximize success?\n3. **Recommended Approach**: Should we:\n   - A) Fill in the `exact?` holes and resubmit\n   - B) Reformulate the problem with the existing progress as building blocks\n   - C) Take a completely different approach\n   - D) Combine multiple partial approaches\n\n4. **Boris Pattern Assessment**: How minimal should the resubmission be? (Less is often more with Aristotle)\n\n5. **Success Probability Estimate**: 0-100% for each proposed strategy\n\nBe specific about Lean 4 tactics and what theorems from Mathlib might help."
