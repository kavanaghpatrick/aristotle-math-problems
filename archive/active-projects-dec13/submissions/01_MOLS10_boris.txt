# Three Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order 10

## Goal

Determine whether three mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 10 exist.

## Problem Statement

A Latin square of order n is an n×n array filled with n different symbols such that each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

Two Latin squares L₁ and L₂ of order n are orthogonal if, when superimposed, every ordered pair of symbols occurs exactly once among the n² cells.

Three Latin squares L₁, L₂, L₃ are mutually orthogonal if every pair (L₁,L₂), (L₁,L₃), (L₂,L₃) is orthogonal.

## The Open Question

For n = 10:
- Two MOLS(10) are known to exist
- Whether three MOLS(10) exist has been open since the 1960s
- This is the smallest n where the maximum number of MOLS is unknown

## Your Task

Either:
1. Construct three mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 10
2. Prove that no such triple exists

## Constraints

- Order n = 10
- Symbols: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Each Latin square is 10×10
- Must verify all three pairwise orthogonalities

## You Decide

- Construction method (if exists)
- Proof technique (if impossible)
- Search strategy
- Any auxiliary lemmas needed

## Verification

For a valid solution:
- Each square has each symbol exactly once per row and column
- For each pair of squares: all 100 ordered pairs (i,j) appear exactly once when superimposed

## Context

- MOLS(n) exist for all n except n ∈ {2, 6}
- For n = 10: at least 2 MOLS exist, at most 9 can exist
- Extensive computational searches have not found 3 MOLS(10)
- Recent work by McKay and others on Latin square enumeration
