# Extremal Self-Dual Binary Code [72, 36, 16]

## Goal

Determine whether an extremal doubly-even self-dual binary code of length 72 exists.

## Problem Statement

A binary linear code C of length n and dimension k is a k-dimensional subspace of F₂ⁿ.

The minimum distance d is the minimum Hamming weight of any nonzero codeword.

A code is:
- Self-dual if C = C⊥ (equals its dual)
- Doubly-even if all codeword weights are divisible by 4
- Extremal if it achieves the upper bound d = 4⌊n/24⌋ + 4

## The Extremal Code Sequence

| Length n | Dimension k | Min Distance d | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 8 | 4 | 4 | Hamming code ✓ |
| 24 | 12 | 8 | Golay code ✓ |
| 48 | 24 | 12 | Known (q48) ✓ |
| 72 | 36 | 16 | **UNKNOWN** |
| 96 | 48 | 20 | Unknown |

## Your Task

Either:
1. Construct a binary code C with parameters [72, 36, 16] that is self-dual and doubly-even
2. Prove no such code exists

## Constraints

- Length: 72 bits
- Dimension: 36 (code has 2³⁶ codewords)
- Minimum distance: 16 (all nonzero codewords have weight ≥ 16)
- Self-dual: C = C⊥
- Doubly-even: All weights ≡ 0 (mod 4)

## You Decide

- Construction method:
  - Quadratic residue construction
  - Circulant matrix approach
  - Automorphism group exploitation
  - Random search with constraints
- Proof technique for non-existence
- Generator matrix form

## Verification

A valid code must satisfy:
1. Generator matrix G is 36 × 72 over F₂
2. G · Gᵀ = 0 (self-orthogonality implies self-duality for n = 2k)
3. All row weights ≡ 0 (mod 4)
4. Minimum weight of span(G) is exactly 16

## Context

- The extended Golay code [24,12,8] has beautiful structure
- Known extremal codes have rich automorphism groups
- Conway and Sloane catalogued many self-dual codes
- Recent work on automorphism groups narrows the search
- If it exists, it would have at least 36 minimum weight codewords

## Algebraic Structure

Self-dual codes over F₂ are connected to:
- Lattices (Construction A)
- Modular forms (weight enumerators)
- Finite simple groups (automorphisms)

The [72, 36, 16] code, if it exists, would extend this beautiful theory.
