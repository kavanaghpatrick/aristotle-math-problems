# Frankl's Union-Closed Sets Conjecture for n = 13

## Goal

Verify Frankl's union-closed sets conjecture for families over a 13-element universe.

## Problem Statement

A family F of sets is union-closed if for any A, B ∈ F, we have A ∪ B ∈ F.

Frankl's Conjecture (1979): For any finite union-closed family F of sets (with F ≠ {∅}), there exists an element that belongs to at least half of the sets in F.

## Known Results

- Conjecture proven for |F| ≤ 50 (various authors)
- Gilmer (2022): Every union-closed family has an element in at least 1% of sets
- Recent improvements: Element exists in at least 38% of sets
- Full conjecture (50%) remains open

## Your Task

For all union-closed families F over universe U = {1, 2, ..., 13}:

Either:
1. Prove that every such family has an element in ≥ |F|/2 sets
2. Find a counterexample: a union-closed family where every element appears in < |F|/2 sets

## Constraints

- Universe: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Family F ⊆ P(U) is union-closed
- F ≠ {∅}
- Must verify: ∃ x ∈ U such that |{A ∈ F : x ∈ A}| ≥ |F|/2

## You Decide

- Lattice-theoretic approach
- SAT encoding of the conjecture
- Induction on family size
- Structural classification of union-closed families
- Which elements to track abundance for

## Verification

For the conjecture to hold at n = 13:
- For every union-closed F over {1,...,13}
- There exists x ∈ {1,...,13}
- Such that x appears in at least ⌈|F|/2⌉ members of F

A counterexample would be:
- A specific union-closed family F
- Where for each x ∈ {1,...,13}: |{A ∈ F : x ∈ A}| < |F|/2

## Context

- The conjecture is equivalent to a statement about lattices
- Union-closed families form a lattice under ⊆
- Smallest potential counterexamples have been ruled out
- Gilmer's breakthrough used entropy methods
- Recent work by Alweiss, Lovett, Wu, Zhang improved bounds

## Structural Insight

Union-closed families have rich structure:
- They form a Moore family (closed under arbitrary intersection of closure)
- Equivalent to closure operators
- Connected to finite lattice theory

The conjecture essentially asks: In any finite lattice, does some join-irreducible element appear in at least half the elements?

## Why n = 13?

- Small enough for exhaustive analysis
- Large enough to test conjecture non-trivially
- Beyond current verified range
- Pushes the boundary of what's computationally verified
