# Ramsey Number R(5,5) Exact Value

## Goal

Determine the exact value of the diagonal Ramsey number R(5,5).

## Problem Statement

The Ramsey number R(s,t) is the minimum n such that any 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph Kₙ contains either:
- A red clique of size s, or
- A blue clique of size t

For the diagonal case R(5,5) = R(5):
- Any 2-coloring of K_n must contain a monochromatic K₅

## Known Bounds (2024)

43 ≤ R(5,5) ≤ 46

This means R(5) ∈ {43, 44, 45, 46}

## Your Task

Determine which value is correct by proving:

1. For the true value n = R(5):
   - Every 2-coloring of Kₙ contains a monochromatic K₅

2. For n-1:
   - There exists a 2-coloring of K_{n-1} with no monochromatic K₅

## You Decide

- Which of {43, 44, 45, 46} to focus on
- Case analysis strategy
- SAT encoding approach
- Certificate construction method
- Proof organization

## Verification

For R(5) = n:
- Upper bound proof: Show every 2-coloring of Kₙ has mono-K₅
- Lower bound witness: Explicit 2-coloring of K_{n-1} avoiding mono-K₅

## Context

- R(3,3) = 6 (trivial)
- R(4,4) = 18 (known since 1955)
- R(5,5) bounds narrowed from [43,49] to [43,46] in 2023-2024
- First progress on diagonal Ramsey in nearly 100 years
- Recent work by Angeltveit, McKay, and others using SAT solvers

## Historical Significance

Determining R(5,5) would be the first new diagonal Ramsey number computed since R(4,4) = 18 was established in 1955.
