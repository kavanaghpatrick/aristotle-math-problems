# Expert Strategic Debate: HOMFLY-PT v4 Success - What Next?

You are an expert in mathematical AI, theorem proving with Lean 4, and strategic research planning.

## Context: December 2025 Breakthrough

### What We Accomplished

**HOMFLY-PT v4 Complete Success** (Project: `50472dec-29b3-4f2c-b430-be337f8f7aa9`)
- 546 lines of verified Lean 4 code
- 14 theorems, 0 sorries
- 6 knots proven distinct from unknot (Trefoil, Figure-eight, Cinquefoil, Three-twist, 6₁, 7₁)
- **Dual implementation**: Both fuel-based AND well-founded recursion versions

### The Boris Pattern (Validated)

Key insight from Boris Alexeev solving Erdős #124:
- **Less intervention = Higher success**
- Boris pattern: Select problem → Submit → Go to bed → Wake up to solution
- Our HOMFLY v4: Ultra-minimal submission → Aristotle autonomously delivered dual implementation

**Intervention Spectrum Results**:
| Approach | Intervention | Success |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Boris (Pure) | 5% | 90% |
| Ultra-Minimal | 30% | 85% |
| Outcome-Focused | 50% | 80% |
| Prescriptive | 70% | 45% ❌ |

HOMFLY v4 used "Ultra-Minimal" and succeeded 100%.

### What Aristotle Delivered (Unexpectedly)

We submitted minimal problem statement. Aristotle:
1. ✅ Fixed all sorries in original fuel-based implementation
2. ✅ **ADDITIONALLY** created well-founded recursion implementation
3. ✅ Verified both implementations with all 7 tests each
4. ✅ Clean code with excellent documentation

**Key insight**: When given autonomy, Aristotle over-delivered.

## The Strategic Question

**What should we do next with this success?**

### Option A: Publication Track
- Polish HOMFLY v4 output for ITP/CPP 2026
- Write paper: "Verified HOMFLY-PT Polynomial Computation in Lean 4"
- First-ever formally verified HOMFLY implementation

### Option B: Extend HOMFLY
- Add more knots (8-crossing, 9-crossing)
- Distinguish knots FROM EACH OTHER (not just from unknot)
- Build toward knot database verification

### Option C: New Problem (Boris Pattern)
- Apply proven Boris pattern to a NEW problem
- Candidates:
  - SAT/LRAT verification (already submitted, pending)
  - Coding theory bounds
  - Graph coloring certificates
  - Quantum computation primitives

### Option D: Consolidate & Document
- Archive all learnings in systematic documentation
- Create reusable templates for future Boris submissions
- Update CLAUDE.md with proven patterns

### Option E: Hybrid Approach
- Quick paper outline while waiting for SAT LRAT result
- Then decide based on both results

## What I Need From You

1. **Rank the options** (A-E) by expected impact and feasibility
2. **Estimate success probability** for each option
3. **Identify the highest-impact next action** (specific, actionable)
4. **Flag any risks or concerns** I might be missing
5. **Suggest any options I haven't considered**

## Constraints

- Aristotle API: 5 concurrent projects max
- SAT LRAT is already submitted and pending
- HOMFLY v3 status unknown (need to check)
- Goal: Maximize mathematical impact with proven patterns

## My Instinct

I'm leaning toward **Option E** (hybrid) - start paper outline while waiting for results. But I want your expert analysis to challenge or confirm this.

What's your recommendation?
