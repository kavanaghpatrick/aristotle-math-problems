# Breakthrough Strategy Options - Jones Unknotting Conjecture

**Date**: December 12, 2025
**Critical Finding**: Jones conjecture **already verified to 24 crossings** (300M+ knots, 2021)

**Implication**: Our 12-crossing target is **incremental**, not breakthrough.

---

## 🚨 THE STRATEGIC REALITY

### What's Been Done (Existing Literature)
- ✅ **24 crossings**: All 253M prime knots verified (2021)
- ✅ **22 crossings**: 2.3 trillion diagrams tested (2018)
- ✅ **20 crossings**: Complete enumeration (1.8B knots)

### What We're Doing
- 🔄 **12 crossings**: 1,126 non-alternating knots
- Status: **Incremental computational verification**
- Novel aspect: **First FORMAL verification** (Lean 4 proofs)

**Value**: Methodology is novel (AI + formal verification), math result is not.

---

## 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH OPTIONS

### Option 1: STICK WITH 12-CROSSING (Safe, Methodology Paper)

**Target**: Complete 1,126 non-alternating knots at 12 crossings

**Novel Contribution**:
- ✅ First **formal verification** (Lean 4 certified proofs)
- ✅ AI-driven proof generation methodology
- ✅ Proof complexity analysis
- ❌ Math result already known computationally

**Publication Potential**:
- **Tier 1**: Nature Machine Intelligence, NeurIPS (AI for Science) - methodology
- **Tier 2**: Experimental Mathematics - formal verification aspect
- **NOT**: Nature/Science (math result not novel enough)

**Timeline**: 3-7 days (if speed holds)

**Risk**: Low (we know it's feasible)

---

### Option 2: PIVOT TO 25-CROSSING (Nature-Worthy, HIGH RISK)

**Target**: First-ever verification of ANY knots at 25 crossings

**Why Breakthrough**:
- ✅ **Never attempted** in literature
- ✅ Beyond current state-of-the-art (24 crossings max)
- ✅ 100-1000x computational harder
- ✅ True frontier of computational knot theory
- ✅ Nature/Science-level impact if successful

**What We'd Verify**:
- Even **partial results** at 25 crossings would be breakthrough
- Could target: 100 knots, 500 knots, or subset by type
- Focus on **non-alternating** to maximize computational feasibility

**Computational Reality Check**:
- 25 crossings: Estimated **1-5 billion** prime knots
- 100-1000x harder per knot than 24 crossings
- Unknown if Aristotle can handle complexity

**Timeline**: Unknown (could be days, weeks, or infeasible)

**Risk**: HIGH
- May hit computational wall
- Aristotle may timeout on every knot
- Could waste days/weeks with zero results

**Mitigation**:
- Test batch of 10 knots at 25 crossings FIRST
- If >50% fail → pivot back
- If successful → proceed carefully

### Option 3: HYBRID - 12-CROSSING + 25-CROSSING PROBE (Recommended)

**Strategy**: Complete 12-crossing (safe publication) + probe 25-crossing frontier

**Phase 1: Validate & Quick Win (This Weekend)**
1. Validate Lean definitions (CRITICAL)
2. Complete 12-crossing with queue manager (3-7 days)
3. Get methodology paper in pipeline

**Phase 2: Frontier Probe (Next Week)**
1. Select 10-20 knots at 25 crossings (simplest by knot invariants)
2. Submit to Aristotle
3. Analyze success rate

**If 25-crossing succeeds >50%**:
→ Pivot to massive 25-crossing effort
→ This becomes Nature-level paper
→ Methodology + breakthrough math result

**If 25-crossing fails >50%**:
→ Already have 12-crossing complete
→ Publish methodology paper (Nature MI / NeurIPS)
→ No time wasted

**Timeline**:
- 12-crossing: 3-7 days
- 25-crossing probe: 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~10 days to know if breakthrough is feasible

**Risk**: Medium (balanced)

---

### Option 4: UNKNOTTING NUMBER COMPLETION (Different Problem, High Impact)

**Target**: Determine all 9 unknown unknotting numbers at 10 crossings

**Why Breakthrough**:
- ✅ Completes fundamental invariant for all knots <11 crossings
- ✅ Related to Jones conjecture but different problem
- ✅ Recent breakthrough (2024-2025): RL agents solved 43 knots
- ✅ Publishable in **Experimental Mathematics** or **Advances in Mathematics**

**What's Unknown**:
- 10-crossing: 9 knots (10-11, 10-47, 10-51, 10-54, 10-61, 10-76, 10-77, 10-79, 10-100)
- 11-crossing: 100+ knots
- 12-crossing: 660+ knots

**Methodology**:
- Use Aristotle to formally verify unknotting strategies
- Combine with RL agents (like 2024 papers)
- Prove bounds via Lean 4

**Timeline**: Weeks to months (harder than Jones verification)

**Risk**: Medium (different expertise required)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: HYBRID APPROACH

### Why Hybrid Wins

**Upside**:
- ✅ **Guaranteed publication** (12-crossing methodology paper)
- ✅ **Breakthrough potential** (25-crossing probe)
- ✅ **Minimal time waste** (know within 10 days if 25 is feasible)
- ✅ **Flexibility** (can pivot based on results)

**Execution**:

**This Weekend** (2 days):
1. ✅ Validate Lean definitions vs SnapPy/Mathematica
2. ✅ Build queue manager

2. Submit test batch to Aristotle
3. Monitor results

**Decision Point** (Tuesday/Wednesday):
- **If 25-crossing >50% success**:
  - Pause 12-crossing

  - Nature-level paper

- **If 25-crossing <50% success**:
  - Continue 12-crossing to completion
  - Methodology paper (Nature MI / NeurIPS)
  - Still solid contribution

**Worst Case**:
- 12-crossing completes successfully
- Methodology paper in Tier 2 journal
- **NOT a failure**, just incremental

**Best Case**:
- 25-crossing feasible
- First-ever verification beyond 24 crossings
- Nature/Science paper
- **Career-making result**

## 🔬 WHAT TO TEST FOR 25-CROSSING PROBE

### Selection Criteria for Test Batch

**Target**: 10 knots at 25 crossings with **simplest** computational properties

**Selection by Invariants**:
1. **Lowest braid index** (complexity scales exponentially with braid width)
2. **Smallest crossing number** in minimal diagram
3. **Low genus** (simpler topology)
4. **Non-satellite** (avoid compound structures)

**Where to Get 25-Crossing Knots**:
- **Problem**: Prime knots not enumerated at 25 crossings!
- **Solution**:
  - Generate via braid closure (systematic 4-5 strand braids)
  - Use KnotTheory package in Mathematica
  - Sample from random knot generators

**Test Batch Structure**:
```python
test_25_crossing = {
    "25_test_01": "4-strand braid closure",
    "25_test_02": "4-strand braid closure",
    ...
    "25_test_10": "5-strand braid closure"
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **>70% complete**: Breakthrough is feasible → GO ALL-IN
- ⚠️ **50-70% complete**: Marginal → Need deeper analysis
- ❌ **<50% complete**: Too hard → Stick with 12-crossing

## 🎬 THE STRATEGIC QUESTION

**User, you asked the RIGHT question.**

Completing 12-crossing is safe but incremental. The math result is known.

**The real question is**:
> Do we want a **guaranteed Tier 2-3 paper** or take a calculated risk for a **Tier 1 breakthrough**?

**My recommendation**:
> **HYBRID APPROACH** - Get the guaranteed result (12-crossing) while simultaneously probing the frontier (25-crossing).
>
> **If 25-crossing works, we pivot. If not, we already won.**

**Total time investment**: ~10 days to know if breakthrough is feasible.

**Risk**: Medium (but calculated - we have fallback)

**Reward**: Potentially career-defining if 25-crossing proves feasible.

**What do you want to do?** 🚀

A. Stick with 12-crossing (safe, guaranteed publication)
B. Pivot to 25-crossing immediately (high risk, high reward)
C. Hybrid approach (probe 25-crossing while completing 12-crossing)
D. Something else entirely (unknotting numbers, different conjecture, etc.)
