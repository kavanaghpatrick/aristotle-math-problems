BRUTAL ASSESSMENT (ROUND 2):

You fought back well. The 18/18 success rate changes the tactical picture, but your strategic "optimality" argument contains a fatal flaw.

### 1. THE CONCESSION (You won this point)
**I retract the "failure" accusation regarding the knot verification.**
18/18 successes (including the 9-crossing batch) proves the *pipeline* works for small to medium complexity.
*   **Implication:** Jones Polynomial verification is now a **low-risk execution task**, not a research gamble. It is your "cash cow."

### 2. THE "OPTIMALITY" TRAP (The Fatal Flaw in Option B)
You argued: *"Could we frame [Sorting Networks] as VERIFICATION ('prove this 77-comparator network is optimal') vs DISCOVERY?"*

**This is mathematically dishonest.**
*   **Upper Bound (Easy):** Verifying the 77-comparator network works? Trivial. `native_decide` checks all $2^{18}$ inputs. Aristotle can do this in minutes.
*   **Lower Bound (The Nightmare):** To prove **optimality** (i.e., that 76 is *impossible*), Aristotle must prove a negative over a search space of $\approx (18!)^{76}$.
*   **The Trap:** You cannot "verify" a lower bound unless you import a massive, existing computer-generated proof certificate (like the LRAT for Boolean Pythagorean Triples). If that certificate doesn't exist, Aristotle has to *discover* the lower bound proof.
*   **Verdict:** You will get a paper saying "We verified C(18) $\le$ 77," which is **not a new result**. The lower bound (the "Nature" part) will timeout.

### 3. THE "NATURE" REALITY CHECK
*   **Formal vs. Computational:** You are right that formal verification > computational verification.
*   **Journal Tier:** However, verifying 25-crossing without finding a *counter-example* or a *new phenomenon* is a **Methodology** breakthrough, not a **Mathematical** one.
    *   *Nature/Science?* Unlikely (unless you find a counter-example to a conjecture).
    *   *Nature Communications / NeurIPS / POPL?* **YES.** This is still career-defining.

### THE FINAL VERDICT: OPTION D (THE "SPEARHEAD")

We stop debating and execute a strategy that leverages your 18/18 momentum but kills the "Optimality" hallucination.

**The Strategy: "The Spear & The Shield"**

1.  **The Shield (Guaranteed Volume):**
    *   **Jones Polynomials:** Run the full 1,126 knot batch immediately. This is your safety net. It guarantees a solid Tier 2 publication ("Large Scale Formal Verification of Knot Invariants").

2.  **The Spear (The Breakthrough):**
    *   **25-Crossing:** Launch it. If it hits, it's the "Methodology" breakthrough (Nature Comms). If it fails, the "Shield" protects you.
    *   *Why?* Unlike Sorting Networks (where failure = 0 value), a partial verification of 25-crossing is still a technical report.

3.  **The Pivot (Drop Sorting, Add Spectral):**
    *   **Drop Sorting Networks:** The lower bound is a trap.
    *   **Add Spectral Gap:** Calculating eigenvalues is **decidable** and purely computational (like Jones). It fits Aristotle's strength (translating computation to proof) without requiring "negative search."

**EXECUTION ORDER:**
1.  **Launch Jones Batch** (Get the compute running).
2.  **Launch 25-Crossing** (The main event).
3.  **Launch Spectral Gap** (The diversity play).

**Do I have your permission to kill the Sorting Network task and proceed with this "Spear & Shield" launch?**
