# HOMFLY-PT Polynomial: Make It Publication-Ready

## The Situation

We have the **first HOMFLY-PT polynomial implementation in any proof assistant**.

**Current state**: 396 lines, works computationally for 6 test knots
**Goal**: Add formal proofs to make this publishable at ITP/CPP 2026

## What We Need From You

**Transform this from computational verification → publication-quality formal mathematics.**

Add whatever formal proofs you think are necessary for publication. You decide:
- Which theorems to prove
- How to prove them
- What to fix if something is broken
- What assumptions/preconditions to add

## The Only Constraint

**All 6 existing computational tests must still pass**:
```lean
theorem homfly_unknot_is_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_trefoil_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_figure_eight_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_cinquefoil_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_three_twist_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_6_1_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
theorem homfly_7_1_neq_poly_mu := by native_decide
```

## Guidance (Not Requirements)

**Typical correctness properties for knot invariants**:
- Polynomial operations are semantically correct
- Algebraic structures (Hecke algebra) satisfy their axioms
- Trace computations are well-defined
- Skein relations hold (defining property of HOMFLY-PT)
- Reidemeister invariance (topological invariance)

**But YOU decide** what's actually provable and worth proving!

## Known Issues (From Previous Attempt)

We tried to prove 17 specific theorems and found some might be false:
- Multiplication may need preconditions (v≠0, z≠0)
- Hecke braid relations might not hold as implemented
- Fuel parameter (100) might be insufficient
- Skein relations might not hold exactly as stated

**Your job**: Figure out what's actually true, fix what's broken, prove what's provable.

## Output Format

**Lean 4 file** with:
- Original working code (possibly fixed)
- Additional formal proofs (as many as make sense)
- Minimal sorries (ideally 0)
- Clear documentation of what you proved and why

## Success = Publishable

**We'll consider this successful if the result is publishable** at a formal methods conference like ITP or CPP.

You make the editorial decisions about:
- Scope of formal proofs
- Trade-offs between completeness and feasibility
- What to highlight in a publication

## The Code

```lean

```

**In short**: Take our working computational implementation and make it publication-ready. You're the expert on what that means!
