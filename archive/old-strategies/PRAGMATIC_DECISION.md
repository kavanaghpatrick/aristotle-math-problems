# Pragmatic Decision Point - 25-Crossing Optimization

**Time**: December 12, 2025 - ~80 minutes into current submission
**Current Status**: First 25-crossing batch (20 knots) IN_PROGRESS since 9:18 AM

---

## 🔍 CURRENT SITUATION

### What's Running:
- **Project ID**: `4aef4bc7-ecf0-4e11-aab4-48da39ed3379`
- **Submitted**: 80 minutes ago
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Contents**: 20 knots at ~25-crossing via braid closures
- **Framing**: "Suboptimal" (batch, braid words, 7.5KB context)

### What We Tried to Optimize:
1. ✅ Got Grok + Codex recommendations
2. ✅ Identified key improvements needed
3. ⚠️ Hit practical roadblocks:
   - SnapPy needs Sage for Jones polynomial computation
   - Generating true 25-crossing knots is complex
   - Full optimization requires significant tooling setup

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### From Optimization Attempts:
1. **Perfect is the enemy of good**
   - Full optimization (PD codes, Lean scaffolding, etc.) requires Sage/Mathematica
   - Takes hours to set up properly
   - May not matter if Aristotle can handle braid words

2. **Current submission is a valid test**
   - Even "suboptimal" framing might work
   - 80 minutes runtime suggests Aristotle is processing (not instant failure)
   - We'll learn actual failure modes vs. theoretical ones

3. **Timeline matters**
   - Current batch: 80 min and counting
   - Expected: Hours to complete (if it completes)
   - Optimization prep: 5-7 hours minimum
   - **Question**: Do we wait or preempt?

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC OPTIONS

### Option A: LET CURRENT RUN FINISH (Recommended)
**Rationale**: Learn from actual results, not theory

**Pros**:
- Already 80 minutes invested
- Will reveal ACTUAL failure modes
- Can optimize based on real data
- If it succeeds (even partially), we win!
- No wasted optimization effort

**Cons**:
- Might fail completely (but we learn why)
- "Wastes" more time if it fails (but sunk cost)

**Timeline**:
- Wait: 1-12 hours more
- Then optimize based on learnings
- **Total**: Same as preemptive optimization

**Recommendation**: ✅ **WAIT FOR RESULTS**

### Option B: CANCEL & OPTIMIZE NOW
**Rationale**: Higher success probability with optimization

**Pros**:
- Maximizes success probability (~5x-10x)
- Implements best practices from experts
- More professional/rigorous approach

**Cons**:
- Requires 5-7 hours setup (Sage, PD codes, etc.)
- Wastes 80 minutes already invested
- Optimizes based on theory, not actual failures

**Timeline**:
- Cancel now
- Optimize: 5-7 hours
- Submit: +hours for processing
- **Total**: Tomorrow earliest

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Only if we're impatient

### Option C: PIVOT TO 12-CROSSING
**Rationale**: Guaranteed win vs. risky breakthrough

**Pros**:
- Known feasible (9-crossing worked great)
- Can complete 1,126 knots in days
- Guaranteed publication (Tier 2-3)
- Still novel (first formal verification)

**Cons**:
- Gives up on 25-crossing breakthrough (Nature-level)
- Less exciting
- Incremental not revolutionary

**Timeline**:
- Start: Immediately
- Complete: 3-7 days
- **Total**: This week

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Fallback if 25-crossing fails

## 📊 DECISION MATRIX

| Option | Success Prob | Impact If Success | Timeline | Effort |
|--------|-------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Wait for current** | 10-30% | Nature-level | 1-12 hrs | Low |
| **Cancel & optimize** | 50-70% | Nature-level | 12-24 hrs | High |
| **Pivot to 12-crossing** | 95% | Tier 2-3 | 3-7 days | Medium |

## 🎲 MY RECOMMENDATION

**WAIT FOR CURRENT SUBMISSION TO FINISH**

**Why**:

1. **Already invested 80 minutes** - it's running, let it run
2. **Learn from reality** - actual failures > theoretical optimization
3. **Might succeed anyway** - even "suboptimal" framing could work
4. **Inform optimization** - if it fails, we'll know exactly why
5. **No time lost** - optimization takes same time either way

**What to do while waiting**:

1. ✅ **Monitor status** every 30-60 minutes
2. ✅ **Prepare optimization scripts** (so they're ready if needed)
3. ✅ **Document learnings** for paper
4. ✅ **Plan next steps** based on results

**Decision points**:

- **If succeeds (>5 knots)**: 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH! Scale up
- **If partial (1-5 knots)**: Optimize and retry rest
- **If fails (0 knots)**: Implement full optimization, resubmit
- **If timeout**: Lower crossing number or optimize framing

## ⏰ TIMELINE PROJECTION

### Scenario 1: Current Succeeds (30% probability)
- Now: Wait 1-12 hours
- Result: >5 knots verified
- Action: Scale to more 25-crossing knots
- **Outcome**: Nature paper, BREAKTHROUGH

### Scenario 2: Current Partial (40% probability)
- Now: Wait 1-12 hours
- Result: 1-5 knots verified
- Action: Optimize framing, retry failed knots
- **Outcome**: Still breakthrough, needs refinement

### Scenario 3: Current Fails (30% probability)
- Now: Wait 1-12 hours
- Result: 0 knots verified
- Action: Full optimization (Sage, PD codes, etc.)
- Resubmit: Tomorrow
- **Outcome**: Learn why, try again smarter

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Next 1-2 hours:
1. ✅ Monitor current submission status
2. ✅ Prepare optimization scripts (don't run yet)
3. ✅ Document current approach for paper

### Next 6-12 hours:
1. ✅ Check status every hour
2. ✅ When complete, analyze results
3. ✅ Make data-driven decision on next step

### Fallback Plan:
- If current fails completely → Full optimization
- If current times out → Try 20-crossing instead
- If all 25-crossing fails → Complete 12-crossing (guaranteed win)

---

## 💭 PHILOSOPHICAL POINT

**We're doing frontier research.**

Failures are data. The current "suboptimal" submission is a valid experiment. Even if it fails, we learn:
- Can Aristotle handle braid words?
- Where does complexity break down?
- What timeout thresholds exist?
- How to frame problems better?

**This is the scientific method.**

Don't let perfectionism prevent experimentation.

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**LET IT RUN. CHECK STATUS IN 1-2 HOURS. DECIDE BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS.**

If it succeeds → We're heroes
If it fails → We optimize smarter

Either way, we WIN.
