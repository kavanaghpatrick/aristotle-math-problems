# Erdős Problem #190: Rainbow vs Monochromatic Arithmetic Progressions

## Problem Statement

Let H(k) be the smallest N such that in any finite colouring of {1, ..., N} (into any number of colours) there is always either a monochromatic k-term arithmetic progression or a rainbow arithmetic progression (where all elements have different colours).

Is it true that H(k)^(1/k) / k → ∞ as k → ∞?

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #190, combining Ramsey theory with rainbow combinatorics.

A monochromatic arithmetic progression is a sequence a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(k-1)d where all terms have the same colour.

A rainbow arithmetic progression is an arithmetic progression where all terms have distinct colours.

H(k) captures the threshold where one of these two structured patterns must appear.

## Goal

Determine whether H(k)^(1/k) / k tends to infinity as k → ∞.
