# Erdős Problem #23 - THE FULL CONJECTURE

## THE PROBLEM (Open Problem)

**Conjecture**: Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges.

## WHAT WE WANT

Prove ANY of the following (in order of preference):

### Option A: The General Conjecture (IDEAL)
```lean
theorem erdos_23_general (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0)
  {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj]
  (h_card : Fintype.card V = 5 * n) (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) :
  ∃ s, s ⊆ G.edgeFinset ∧ s.card ≤ n^2 ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

### Option B: Beat the Current Best Bound
Current best: 1.064n² (Balogh-Clemen-Lidický 2021)

Prove for ANY constant c < 1.064:
```lean
theorem erdos_23_improved (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0)
  {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj]
  (h_card : Fintype.card V = 5 * n) (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) :
  ∃ s, s ⊆ G.edgeFinset ∧ (s.card : ℝ) ≤ c * n^2 ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

### Option C: Prove for All n (Structural Proof)
A non-computational proof that works for arbitrary n, even if we can't compute the exact bound.

## KEY INSIGHT: The Extremal Graph

The bound n² is TIGHT for the blow-up of C₅:
- Take the 5-cycle C₅ = (v₀, v₁, v₂, v₃, v₄)
- Replace each vertex vᵢ with an independent set Vᵢ of n vertices
- Connect all of Vᵢ to all of Vᵢ₊₁ (indices mod 5)
- This graph is triangle-free and has 5n vertices
- Removing its odd cycle structure requires removing exactly n² edges

Any proof must show that C₅ blow-ups are the WORST CASE.

## PRIOR RESULT (Already Proved)

The n=1 case was proved computationally:
```lean
theorem erdos_problem_23_case_n_1
  (h_card : Fintype.card V = 5) (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) :
  ∃ s, s ⊆ G.edgeFinset ∧ s.card ≤ 1 ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

This used brute-force over 1024 graphs. That approach does NOT scale.

## You Decide
- Which option to pursue (A, B, or C)
- The proof technique (structural decomposition, probabilistic, spectral, etc.)
- Whether to analyze the C₅ blow-up structure
- Which lemmas and intermediate results to develop

## DO NOT
- Just prove another small case (n=2, n=3) computationally
- That doesn't advance the mathematics

## Success Criteria
- Prove a result that applies to INFINITELY MANY values of n
- Zero sorries
- Compiles with Lean 4.24.0 + Mathlib
