# Erdős Problem #593 - Hypergraphs in Uncountable Chromatic Hypergraphs

## THE PROBLEM ($500 Prize)

Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear (as subhypergraphs) in EVERY 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number > ℵ₀.

## Expected Answer (Based on Graph Analog)

For graphs: A finite graph appears in every graph with χ ≥ ℵ₁ iff it is BIPARTITE.

For 3-uniform hypergraphs: A finite hypergraph H appears in every hypergraph with χ > ℵ₀ iff H is 2-COLORABLE.

## Definitions

A 3-uniform hypergraph H = (V, E) where every edge has exactly 3 vertices.

H is 2-colorable if there exists c : V → {0,1} such that no edge is monochromatic.

H embeds into G if there's an injective f : V(H) → V(G) mapping edges to edges.

## Formal Statement

```lean
structure Hypergraph3 (V : Type*) where
  edges : Set (Set V)
  is_uniform : ∀ e ∈ edges, e.ncard = 3

def IsTwoColorable (H : Hypergraph3 V) : Prop :=
  ∃ c : V → Bool, ∀ e ∈ H.edges, ∃ x y ∈ e, c x ≠ c y

def HasChromaticNumberGtAleph0 (H : Hypergraph3 V) : Prop :=
  ∀ (c : V → ℕ), ¬ IsColoring H c

def AppearsInAllUncountableChromatic (H : Hypergraph3 V) : Prop :=
  Finite V ∧ ∀ G : Hypergraph3 W, HasChromaticNumberGtAleph0 G → EmbedsInto H G

```

## Two Directions to Prove

1. **IsTwoColorable H → AppearsInAllUncountableChromatic H**
   Every 2-colorable hypergraph embeds into every hypergraph with χ > ℵ₀.
   (The partial proof already has progress on this direction!)

2. **AppearsInAllUncountableChromatic H → IsTwoColorable H**
   If H is NOT 2-colorable, construct a hypergraph with χ > ℵ₀ that doesn't contain H.

## Previous Progress (from partial output)

The partial proof established:
- EmbedsInto_CompleteTwoColorable: 2-colorable H embeds into complete 2-colorable hypergraph
- Direction 1 conditional on Erdős-Hajnal property

## You Decide
- How to complete direction 1
- How to prove direction 2 (likely construct explicit counterexample)
- Which auxiliary lemmas to develop

## Success Criterion
Prove the full characterization (both directions) with zero sorries.
