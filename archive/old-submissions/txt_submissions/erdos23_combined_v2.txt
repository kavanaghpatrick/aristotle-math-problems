# Erdős Problem #23 - Combined Approach

## Goal
Prove: Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges.

## Strategy: Combine Three Partial Results

From previous attempts, we have three complementary pieces:

### Piece 1: C5 Blow-Up Theory (b2749da7)
- **Proved**: C5 blow-up is triangle-free with exactly 5n² edges
- **Proved**: C5 blow-up needs exactly n² edge deletions (tight!)
- **Proved**: Any graph respecting C5 partition → ≤n² deletions

### Piece 2: Structural Approach (dbd91222)
- **Proved**: C5-colorable graphs → ≤n² deletions
- **Key insight**: Uses fiber sizes and pigeonhole principle

### Piece 3: Quantitative Bounds (4cdc2339)
- **Proved**: Erdos23Bound 1.5625 (i.e., any triangle-free graph → ≤1.5625n² deletions)
- **Technique**: Mantel's theorem + Cauchy-Schwarz + probabilistic method

## Combined Strategy

The key observation: **Andrásfai-Kruskal-Szemerédi theorem** (1974) states:
- If G is triangle-free and has minimum degree δ(G) > 2n/5, then G is bipartite

This means for triangle-free graphs:
1. If min degree > 2n (on 5n vertices, so 2n/5 of total = 2n when total = 5n), G is ALREADY bipartite (0 deletions needed)
2. If min degree ≤ 2n, we can use the structural approach

**Alternative**: Use the fact that triangle-free graphs are 3-chromatic, and 3-colorable graphs have nice structure.

## You Decide

Choose the approach that works best:

**Option A**: Use Andrásfai-Kruskal-Szemerédi directly
- High min degree → already bipartite
- Low min degree → use Turán-type bounds

**Option B**: Use C5 blow-up as extremal example
- Prove any triangle-free graph is a subgraph of a C5 blow-up (or bounded by it)
- Apply the subgraph bound theorem

**Option C**: Pure structural via homomorphisms
- Triangle-free → 3-colorable → admits specific structure
- Exploit structure for edge deletion bound

## Useful Mathlib Theorems
- `SimpleGraph.CliqueFree` - triangle-free condition
- `SimpleGraph.Colorable` - k-colorability
- `SimpleGraph.deleteEdges` - edge deletion
- `SimpleGraph.IsBipartite` - bipartiteness (= 2-colorable)
- Turán-type bounds in `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Turan`

## Success Criteria
- Zero sorries
- Compiles without errors
- Proves: ∀ n, ∀ G on 5n vertices, G.CliqueFree 3 → ∃ S, S.card ≤ n² ∧ (G.deleteEdges S).IsBipartite
