# Erdős Problem #593 - Hypergraph Chromatic Characterization

## Goal
Characterize which finite 3-uniform hypergraphs H have the property that every hypergraph with uncountable chromatic number contains H as a subhypergraph.

## Context: What You Already Proved (from 43528a1d)

### Definitions Created
```lean
structure Hypergraph3 (V : Type*) where
  edges : Set (Set V)
  is_uniform : ∀ e ∈ edges, e.ncard = 3

def IsTwoColorable {V : Type*} (H : Hypergraph3 V) : Prop :=
  ∃ c : V → Bool, ∀ e ∈ H.edges, ∃ x ∈ e, ∃ y ∈ e, c x ≠ c y

def IsColoring {V C : Type*} (H : Hypergraph3 V) (c : V → C) : Prop :=
  ∀ e ∈ H.edges, ∃ x ∈ e, ∃ y ∈ e, c x ≠ c y

def EmbedsInto {V W : Type*} (H : Hypergraph3 V) (G : Hypergraph3 W) : Prop :=
  ∃ f : V → W, Function.Injective f ∧ ∀ e ∈ H.edges, (f '' e) ∈ G.edges

def AppearsInAllUncountableChromatic {V : Type*} (H : Hypergraph3 V) : Prop :=
  Finite V ∧ ∀ (W : Type*) (G : Hypergraph3 W), HasChromaticNumberGtAleph0 G → EmbedsInto H G
```

### Key Theorems Proved
1. `EmbedsInto_CompleteTwoColorable_Self`: Two-colorable graphs embed into complete two-colorable
2. `EmbedsInto_CompleteBipartite_of_TwoColorable`: Finite two-colorable → embeds into K_{n,m}
3. `EmbedsInto_Transitive`: Embedding is transitive
4. `IsBergeCycle`: Berge cycle definition in 3-uniform hypergraphs
5. `IncidenceGraph_Bipartite`: Incidence graph of any hypergraph is bipartite
6. `IncidenceGraph_NeighborSet_Card`: Each edge has exactly 3 neighbors in incidence graph

### Key Insight from Previous Attempt
- Berge-acyclic hypergraphs are 2-colorable (proven via incidence graph)
- The MyColoring function uses distance in the incidence graph
- Need to connect: NOT 2-colorable → contains Berge cycle → appears in all uncountable chromatic

## What Remains

The characterization theorem:
```lean
theorem erdos_593_characterization {V : Type*} [Finite V] (H : Hypergraph3 V) :
    AppearsInAllUncountableChromatic H ↔ ¬ IsTwoColorable H
```

**Key lemma needed**:
```lean
lemma not_two_colorable_iff_contains_berge_cycle (H : Hypergraph3 V) :
    ¬ IsTwoColorable H ↔ ∃ k v e, IsBergeCycle H k v e
```

## You Decide
- The proof approach
- Which direction to prove first
- How to connect Berge cycles to uncountable chromatic number

## Success Criteria
- Zero sorries
- Compiles without errors
- Proves the characterization theorem above
