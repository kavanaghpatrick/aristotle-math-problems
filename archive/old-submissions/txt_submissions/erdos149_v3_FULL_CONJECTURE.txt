# Erdős #149: Strong Chromatic Index Conjecture (Full)

## Problem Statement (Erdős-Nešetřil 1985)

For ANY graph G with maximum degree Δ, the strong chromatic index satisfies:
χ'_s(G) ≤ (5/4)Δ²

The strong chromatic index is the minimum number of colors needed to color edges such that edges at distance ≤ 1 (sharing a vertex or sharing an adjacent edge) receive different colors.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT

**DO NOT add any restrictive hypotheses.** The previous attempt incorrectly added `h : G.maxDegree ≤ 2`, proving only a trivial case. This submission requires the FULL conjecture for ALL graphs, regardless of maximum degree.

**DO NOT modify the theorem statement.** Prove it EXACTLY as given below.

## Formal Lean 4 Theorem (PROVE EXACTLY AS STATED)

```lean
import Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Basic
import Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Coloring
import Mathlib.Data.Rat.Basic

variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]

/-- Strong chromatic index: minimum colors for edge coloring where edges at distance ≤ 1 get different colors -/
noncomputable def SimpleGraph.strongChromaticIndex (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj] : ℕ :=
  sorry -- Standard definition via edge distance graph

/-- Erdős-Nešetřil Conjecture (1985): χ'_s(G) ≤ (5/4)Δ² for all graphs G -/
theorem erdos_149 (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj] :
    (G.strongChromaticIndex : ℚ) ≤ (5/4) * (G.maxDegree : ℚ)^2 := by
  sorry
```

## Success Criteria

1. Zero sorries in the main theorem `erdos_149`
2. Theorem applies to ALL graphs (no degree restrictions)
3. Uses the exact bound (5/4)Δ²
4. Compiles with Mathlib v4.24.0

## You Decide

- How to define `strongChromaticIndex` formally
- Which proof strategy to use
- What helper lemmas to create
- How to structure the proof

But you MUST prove the full conjecture without adding hypotheses like `maxDegree ≤ k` for any k.
