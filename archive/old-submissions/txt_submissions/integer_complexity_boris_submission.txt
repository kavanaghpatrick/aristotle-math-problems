# Integer Complexity Conjecture - Boris Pattern Submission

## Goal
Prove the Integer Complexity Conjecture for 2^k · 3^ℓ:

For all non-negative integers k, ℓ (excluding k = ℓ = 0):
||2^k · 3^ℓ|| = 2k + 3ℓ

where ||n|| denotes the integer complexity of n (the minimum number of 1's
needed to represent n using only addition, multiplication, and parentheses).

## You Decide
- Which proof strategy to use
- Which lemmas to create
- How to structure the formalization
- Which intermediate theorems to prove

## Mathematical Background

### Definition
The integer complexity f(n) = ||n|| is the minimum number of 1's needed to
represent a positive integer n using:
- The digit 1
- Addition (+)
- Multiplication (×)
- Parentheses

### Examples
- ||1|| = 1 (just "1")
- ||2|| = 2 (1+1)
- ||3|| = 3 (1+1+1)
- ||4|| = 4 ((1+1)×(1+1))
- ||6|| = 5 ((1+1)×(1+1+1))
- ||12|| = 7 ((1+1+1)×(1+1+1+1))

### Known Results
- Lower bound: ||n|| ≥ 3·log₃(n) for all n (Selfridge)
- Verified: ||2^k · 3^ℓ|| = 2k + 3ℓ for k ≤ 48 and arbitrary ℓ
- The conjecture essentially says: 2^k · 3^ℓ are "optimal" numbers

### Equivalent Formulation
The conjecture states that for numbers of the form 2^k · 3^ℓ:
- The most efficient representation uses k copies of (1+1) and ℓ copies of (1+1+1)
- No clever algebraic identity can reduce the count below 2k + 3ℓ

## Constraint
Must prove for ALL k, ℓ ≥ 0 with (k,ℓ) ≠ (0,0).

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Formal proof in Lean 4
- ✅ Zero sorries
- ✅ Compiles without errors
- ✅ Proves ||2^k · 3^ℓ|| = 2k + 3ℓ for all valid k, ℓ
