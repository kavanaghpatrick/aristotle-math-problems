# Erdős Problem #64: Cycles of Length 2^k ($1000 Prize)

## Problem Statement

Does every finite graph with minimum degree at least 3 contain a cycle of length 2^k for some k ≥ 2?

## Context

This is Erdős Problem #64, an open problem in graph theory with a $1000 prize.

The question asks: if G is a finite graph where every vertex has degree at least 3, must G contain a cycle whose length is a power of 2 (specifically 4, 8, 16, 32, ...)?

A cycle of length n in a graph is a closed path visiting exactly n distinct vertices.

## Goal

Prove or disprove: For every finite graph G with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ 3, there exists an integer k ≥ 2 such that G contains a cycle of length exactly 2^k.
