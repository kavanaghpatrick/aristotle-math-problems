# Erdős Problem #23 - Option B: Beat the 1.064n² Bound

## THE PROBLEM

Current best result (Balogh-Clemen-Lidický 2021): Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most **1.064n²** edges.

Conjecture: The true bound is **n²**.

## YOUR GOAL

Prove a better bound than 1.064n². Any constant c < 1.064 is progress.

## TARGET THEOREM

```lean
theorem erdos_23_improved (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0)
  {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj]
  (h_card : Fintype.card V = 5 * n) (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) :
  ∃ s, s ⊆ G.edgeFinset ∧ (s.card : ℝ) ≤ c * n^2 ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

Where c is any constant you can prove, ideally c < 1.064.

Even c = 1.05 or c = 1.02 would be significant.

## KNOWN BOUNDS
- Trivial: 2.5n² (greedy)
- Old: ~1.5n²
- Current best: 1.064n²
- Conjecture: n²

## You Decide
- Which constant c to target
- The proof technique (flag algebras, regularity lemma, probabilistic, etc.)
- Whether to adapt Balogh-Clemen-Lidický's approach

## Success Criteria
- Proves bound with c < 1.064
- Zero sorries
