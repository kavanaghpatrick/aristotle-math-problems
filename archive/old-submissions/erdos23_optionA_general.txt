# Erdős Problem #23 - Option A: The General Conjecture

## THE PROBLEM

Prove for ALL n:
Every triangle-free graph on 5n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most n² edges.

## TARGET THEOREM

```lean
theorem erdos_23_general (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0)
  {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj]
  (h_card : Fintype.card V = 5 * n) (h_tf : G.CliqueFree 3) :
  ∃ s, s ⊆ G.edgeFinset ∧ s.card ≤ n^2 ∧ (G.deleteEdges s).Colorable 2
```

## KEY INSIGHT

The bound n² is TIGHT for the blow-up of C₅:
- Take C₅ and replace each vertex with n independent vertices
- Connect adjacent independent sets completely
- This is triangle-free, has 5n vertices, needs exactly n² removals

The proof must show C₅ blow-ups are the worst case.

## You Decide
- Proof technique (induction on n, structural decomposition, etc.)
- Which lemmas to develop
- How to exploit the C₅ structure

## Success Criteria
- Proves the theorem for ALL n > 0
- Zero sorries
