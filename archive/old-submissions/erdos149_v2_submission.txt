# Erdős Problem #149 - Strong Chromatic Index

## THE ACTUAL CONJECTURE (Open since 1985)

Prove: For every graph G with maximum degree Δ,
  χs(G) ≤ (5/4)Δ²

where χs(G) is the strong chromatic index (minimum colors to edge-color G so no two edges at distance ≤ 2 share a color).

Equivalently: χ(L(G)²) ≤ (5/4)Δ² where L(G) is the line graph.

## Known Results (DO NOT just reprove these)
- Trivial bound: 2Δ² (greedy)
- Molloy-Reed 1997: 1.998Δ²  
- Bruhn-Joos 2018: 1.93Δ²
- Hurley et al 2022: 1.772Δ² (current best)
- CONJECTURE: (5/4)Δ² = 1.25Δ² (tight for blowups of C₅)

## What We Want
PROVE the (5/4)Δ² bound, OR find a counterexample.

Do NOT just prove a weaker bound like 2Δ² or 4Δ² - that's already known and not novel.

## Formal Statement

```lean
def SimpleGraph.strongChromaticIndex (G : SimpleGraph V) : ℕ :=
  G.lineGraph.square.chromaticNumber

-- THE CONJECTURE
theorem erdos_149 : ∀ (V : Type*) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] 
  (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
  (G.strongChromaticIndex : ℚ) ≤ (5/4) * (G.maxDegree : ℚ)^2 := by
  sorry
```

## Key Insight
The bound is TIGHT for blowups of C₅ (5-cycle). This suggests:
- The proof must use properties that C₅ blowups saturate
- Probabilistic methods alone won't suffice
- Need structural graph theory

## You Decide
- The proof technique
- Whether to prove or disprove
- Which lemmas to develop

## Success Criterion
Prove erdos_149 with the (5/4) constant, zero sorries.
