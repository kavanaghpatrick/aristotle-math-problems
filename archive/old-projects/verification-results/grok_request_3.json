(e.g., \"prove n+0=n\")\n   - Is it a renamed/disguised version of a solved problem?\n   - Are the bounds too weak to be interesting?\n   - Would solving this bounded case tell us anything new?\n\n5. **ESTIMATE TRUE SUCCESS PROBABILITY**:\n   Current estimate: 75%\n   - Is this realistic?\n   - What would increase/decrease the probability?\n   - What are the main obstacles?\n\n6. **RECOMMEND REFINEMENTS**:\n   - How should we reformulate the problem?\n   - What's the optimal scope (broader/narrower)?\n   - What preparatory work is needed?\n   - What's the best attack strategy for Aristotle?\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```json\n{\n  \"issue_number\": 3,\n  \"verdict\": \"KEEP | REFORMULATE | REJECT\",\n  \"still_unsolved\": true/false,\n  \"confidence\": \"HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW\",\n  \"formalizability\": \"EASY | MEDIUM | HARD | VERY HARD\",\n  \"true_success_probability\": \"X%\",\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"concerns\"],\n  \"recommended_refinements\": [\"specific\", \"improvements\"],\n  \"proof_strategies\": [\"strategy1\", \"strategy2\"],\n  \"key_obstacles\": [\"obstacle1\", \"obstacle2\"],\n  \"preparatory_steps\": [\"step1\", \"step2\"],\n  \"reasoning\": \"detailed explanation of your assessment\"\n}\n```\n\nBE BRUTALLY HONEST. We want to MAXIMIZE actual success, not preserve our existing list.\n"
