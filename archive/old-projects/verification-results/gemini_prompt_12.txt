CRITICAL VERIFICATION TASK - Issue #12: Boolean Schur Number S(4)

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Find the smallest n such that every 4-coloring of {1,2,...,n} contains a monochromatic solution to a + b = c.

YOUR TASK (ULTRA-THOROUGH):

1. **VERIFY IF TRULY UNSOLVED**:
   - Search arXiv, MathOverflow, recent papers (2023-2025)
   - Check if this has been solved recently
   - Verify the problem statement is accurate
   - Check for subtleties (e.g., is "bounded case" actually interesting?)
   - Look for "almost solved" cases or trivial variants

2. **ASSESS FORMALIZABILITY**:
   - Can this be precisely stated in Lean 4?
   - Are all necessary definitions in Mathlib?
   - What's missing from Mathlib that would be needed?
   - Rate formalizability: EASY / MEDIUM / HARD / VERY HARD

3. **IDENTIFY PROOF STRATEGIES**:
   - What are ALL known approaches to this problem?
   - Which approaches are most suitable for automated proving?
   - What are the key lemmas/techniques required?
   - Are there simpler special cases to try first?

4. **DETECT RED FLAGS**:
   - Is this actually trivial? (e.g., "prove n+0=n")
   - Is it a renamed/disguised version of a solved problem?
   - Are the bounds too weak to be interesting?
   - Would solving this bounded case tell us anything new?

5. **ESTIMATE TRUE SUCCESS PROBABILITY**:
   Current estimate: 25%
   - Is this realistic?
   - What would increase/decrease the probability?
   - What are the main obstacles?

6. **RECOMMEND REFINEMENTS**:
   - How should we reformulate the problem?
   - What's the optimal scope (broader/narrower)?
   - What preparatory work is needed?
   - What's the best attack strategy for Aristotle?

BE BRUTALLY HONEST. We want to MAXIMIZE actual success, not preserve our existing list.
