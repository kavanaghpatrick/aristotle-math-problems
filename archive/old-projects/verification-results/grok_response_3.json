It is a significant problem in group theory and character theory, and its formalization in Lean 4 is challenging due to the complexity of the required mathematical structures and theorems. The problem statement is accurate, but formalizing it in Lean 4 is rated as HARD due to the need for extensive group theory and character theory definitions and theorems, many of which are not yet available in Mathlib. \n\n  Known approaches to the McKay conjecture include character theory, modular representation theory, and connections with other conjectures like the Alperin weight conjecture. However, none of these approaches have led to a complete proof, and adapting them for automated proving in Lean 4 would require significant preparatory work. \n\n  The true success probability is estimated at 20%, reflecting the high difficulty and the current state of formalization tools. This probability could increase with advancements in Mathlib and collaboration with experts. The main obstacles are the complexity of the required mathematics and the gaps in existing formalization libraries. \n\n  Recommended refinements include starting with simpler special cases and focusing on building the necessary theoretical foundation in Mathlib. Engaging with the mathematical community could provide valuable insights and increase the chances of success.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":640,"completion_tokens":541,"total_tokens":1181,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":640,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
