To provide the assessment for Issue #17, I have researched the current status of the Burnside Problem B(2,5) and its formalizability in Lean 4.

### **Research Findings**

1.  **Status**: The finiteness of the free Burnside group **B(2,5)** (2 generators, exponent 5) is a major **unsolved** problem in group theory.
    *   Known Finite: B(d, 2), B(d, 3), B(d, 4), B(d, 6).
    *   Known Infinite: B(d, n) for odd $n \ge 665$ (Adian-Novikov, improved later).
    *   **B(2,5)** is the smallest open case for the free Burnside problem (exponent $n>0$).
    *   The *Restricted* Burnside Problem (finding the largest *finite* quotient) was solved by Zelmanov (Fields Medal), implying a largest finite quotient $B_0(2,5)$ exists (order $5^{34}$). The open question is whether the *free* version $B(2,5)$ has a non-trivial kernel onto $B_0(2,5)$.

2.  **Formalizability**:
    *   **Easy to state**: The definition of a free group and the exponent relation are standard. We can easily define `FreeBurnsideGroup (Fin 2) 5` as a quotient of `FreeGroup (Fin 2)` by the subgroup generated by $\{g^5 \mid g \in F\}$.
    *   **Mathlib Support**: Mathlib has `FreeGroup` and `Exponent`. Constructing the specific quotient is straightforward (likely less than 20 lines of Lean).
    *   **Proof**: The proof of finiteness (or infiniteness) is completely out of reach for current automated theorem provers and even human mathematicians.
