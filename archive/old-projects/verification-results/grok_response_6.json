The problem statement appears accurate and presents a challenging cyclic inequality. The formalizability in Lean 4 is rated as HARD due to the complexity of handling cyclic inequalities and the need for advanced mathematical libraries that might not be fully developed in Mathlib yet.\n\nThe true success probability is estimated at 40%, lower than the initial 60%, due to the complexity of the problem and the lack of obvious approaches. This probability could be increased by finding a special case that simplifies the problem or by discovering a new inequality that directly applies to this scenario. The main obstacles include the cyclic nature of the inequality and the difficulty in finding a tight enough bound.\n\nRed flags include the potential for trivialization if a special case is found and the possibility that this inequality might be connected to known inequalities, which could simplify the problem. Recommended refinements include investigating special cases, exploring related inequalities, and considering a broader scope to find similar inequalities that might provide insights.\n\nProof strategies should focus on using known inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz and AM-GM, exploring the properties of cyclic inequalities, and using substitution methods to transform the inequality. Preparatory steps should include reviewing literature on cyclic inequalities, deepening understanding of relevant inequalities, and experimenting with numerical methods to gain insight into the inequality's behavior.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":645,"completion_tokens":623,"total_tokens":1268,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":645,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
