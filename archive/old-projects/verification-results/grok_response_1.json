While it is possible to verify this bounded case computationally, the effort required is significant and may not yield new insights into the general conjecture. The problem can be formalized in Lean 4 with the help of Mathlib, but the formalization of the verification process would be complex due to the need for efficient prime number generation and checking algorithms. The true success probability is estimated at 50% due to the computational challenges and the lack of a known general proof strategy that can be easily adapted to the bounded case. Reforming the problem to focus on a smaller range or a related but more tractable problem could increase the chances of success and provide more meaningful results.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":632,"completion_tokens":549,"total_tokens":1181,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":632,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
