CRITICAL VERIFICATION: CRITICAL VERIFICATION TASK - Issue #1: Goldbach Conjecture for n ≤ 10^6

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Prove that every even integer n where 4 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

YOUR TASK (ULTRA-THOROUGH):

1. **VERIFY IF TRULY UNSOLVED**:
   - Search arXiv, MathOverflow, recent papers (2023-2025)
   - Check if this has been solved recently
   - Verify the problem statement is accurate
   - Check for subtleties (e.g., is "bounded case" actually interesting?)
   - Look for "almost solved" cases or trivial variants

2. **ASSESS FORMALIZABILITY**:
   - Can this be precisely stated in Lean 4?
   - Are all necessary definitions in Mathlib?
   - What's missing from Mathlib that would be needed?
   - Rate formalizability: EASY / MEDIUM / HARD / VERY HARD

3. **IDENTIFY PROOF STRATEGIES**:
   - What are ALL known approaches to this problem?
   - Which approaches are most suitable for automated proving?
   - What are the key lemmas/techniques required?
   - Are there simpler special cases to try first?

4. **DETECT RED FLAGS**:
   - Is this actually trivial? (e.g., "prove n+0=n")
   - Is it a renamed/disguised version of a solved problem?
   - Are the bounds too weak to be interesting?
   - Would solving this bounded case tell us anything new?

5. **ESTIMATE TRUE SUCCESS PROBABILITY**:
   Current estimate: 85%
   - Is this realistic?
   - What would increase/decrease the probability?
   - What are the main obstacles?

6. **RECOMMEND REFINEMENTS**:
   - How should we reformulate the problem?
   - What's the optimal scope (broader/narrower)?
   - What preparatory work is needed?
   - What's the best attack strategy for Aristotle?

BE BRUTALLY HONEST. We want to MAXIMIZE actual success, not preserve our existing list.. Output to verification-results/codex_result_1.md

**Analyzing verification and formalization constraints**

I’m outlining the approach to verify Goldbach's conjecture up to 1,000,000 computationally, noting it's a solved, trivial problem with known references, and considering how to formalize this proof in Lean 4 via brute force checking. I recognize the environment is read-only, so I can’t write output files but will produce the final JSON response inline, also mentioning this limitation. I’m preparing a thorough plan that evaluates success likelihood, existing methods, and suggests refinements for more meaningful verification.

**Summarizing verification plan and limitations**

I’m organizing a detailed plan to assess the verification status and strategies for the Goldbach conjecture up to 1,000,000, including reasoning on formalizability, confidence, proof approaches, obstacles, and preparatory steps, while noting that I can’t write output files due to the read-only environment.

I couldn’t write to `verification-results/codex_result_1.md` because the filesystem is read-only, so I’m returning the result inline instead.

**Assessment**
- Goldbach’s even conjecture has been verified far beyond 10⁶ (e.g., Oliveira e Silva–Herzog–Pardi 2014 checked up to 4·10¹⁸), so this bounded instance is long solved and easily reproducible with a short sieve script. No recent 2023–2025 developments change that: the full conjecture remains open, but finite verification at 10⁶ is trivial and already published decades ago.
- Formalizing “every even n ≤ 10⁶ is the sum of two primes” in Lean 4 is feasible: Mathlib already has primes, even numbers, enumerations, and computation. The main cost is importing a certified table of primes or Goldbach pairs and showing it covers the range. That’s a moderately sized but straightforward data-entry/mechanical proof task.
- Known approaches reduce to (1) direct sieve-based enumeration, (2) reductions using analytic number theory (circle method, zero-density estimates) plus finite checking, and (3) prime-pair precomputation stored as certificates. Automated provers suit approach (1) if supplied with certified data; analytic approaches are machines-assisted but not automated-inside-Lean friendly.
- The request has red flags: it’s long settled, the bound is minuscule, and solving it offers no new math insight. Resources should shift to either genuinely new bounds or formalizing the already known large-scale verification.

  "reasoning": "Goldbach’s even conjecture is open in general, but numerical verification already covers all even n up to 4·10^18 (Oliveira e Silva, Herzog, and Pardi, Math. Comp. 83 (2014)), and subsequent computations further extended the bound. Therefore the statement for n ≤ 10^6 has been provably true for decades, with multiple independent verifications using simple sieve-based programs. There is no new research value in re-proving this bound; a modern laptop can check it in milliseconds. If one wants a Lean proof, Mathlib already includes primality, parity, and finite computations, so a certified dataset could be imported—moderate effort but conceptually routine. Automated provers would just replay the computation; no analytic breakthrough is required. The claimed 85% success probability is moot because the result is already known with certainty. Meaningful work would involve either formalizing existing large-scale verifications with certificates or tackling genuinely open variants."
