The problem statement is accurate and well-defined, focusing on the smallest N such that any 3-coloring of {1,2,...,N} contains a monochromatic 5-term arithmetic progression. There are no known subtleties or trivial variants that would change the nature of the problem.\\n\\nFormalizing this problem in Lean 4 would be hard due to the complexity of the definitions and the need for extensive combinatorial and number-theoretic libraries. While some basic definitions might be available in Mathlib, more advanced tools and lemmas specific to Ramsey theory and arithmetic progressions would likely be missing.\\n\\nKnown approaches to this problem include brute force search, using known bounds to reduce the search space, and exploring combinatorial properties. However, none of these approaches have yet yielded the exact value for W(3,5). Automated proving might be suitable for verifying specific instances or smaller cases, but the general problem remains challenging.\\n\\nThe current estimate of a 30% success probability seems optimistic. A more realistic estimate is 20%, given the computational intensity and the lack of a known general method to compute exact Van der Waerden numbers for large parameters. The main obstacles are the computational complexity and the difficulty in proving non-existence of certain colorings.\\n\\nTo increase the probability of success, new computational methods or algorithms need to be developed. Exploring related problems in Ramsey theory and combinatorial number theory might provide insights. Additionally, the use of machine learning to predict or narrow down the search space could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the problem is challenging, it is worth keeping on the list due to its fundamental nature in Ramsey theory and the potential for significant advances in computational methods.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":638,"completion_tokens":686,"total_tokens":1324,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":638,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
