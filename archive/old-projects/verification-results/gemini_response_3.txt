The McKay conjecture has been proven mathematically as of 2023-2024 by Späth and Cabanes. Formalizing the *proof* in Lean 4 is currently effectively impossible because it depends on the Classification of Finite Simple Groups (CFSG), which is not yet in Mathlib. Formalizing the *statement* is easy and feasible.

  "reasoning": "The McKay conjecture was recently proved (2024) using the Inductive McKay condition and the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. Lean 4 does not have CFSG, so a full formal proof is impossible. However, the statement itself can be easily formalized using existing Mathlib definitions. If the goal is an AI benchmark, asking for the *statement* is a valid (but easy) task. Asking for the *proof* is an impossible task."

e statement is easy but not a 'proof' task. The best use of this issue is as a formalization benchmark for the statement and specific small group examples."
