CRITICAL VERIFICATION: CRITICAL VERIFICATION TASK - Issue #3: McKay Conjecture Formalization

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Formalize the McKay conjecture in Lean 4: For a finite group G and prime p, the number of irreducible characters of G with degree not divisible by p equals the same number for the normalizer of a Sylow p-subgroup.

YOUR TASK (ULTRA-THOROUGH):

1. **VERIFY IF TRULY UNSOLVED**:
   - Search arXiv, MathOverflow, recent papers (2023-2025)
   - Check if this has been solved recently
   - Verify the problem statement is accurate
   - Check for subtleties (e.g., is "bounded case" actually interesting?)
   - Look for "almost solved" cases or trivial variants

2. **ASSESS FORMALIZABILITY**:
   - Can this be precisely stated in Lean 4?
   - Are all necessary definitions in Mathlib?
   - What's missing from Mathlib that would be needed?
   - Rate formalizability: EASY / MEDIUM / HARD / VERY HARD

3. **IDENTIFY PROOF STRATEGIES**:
   - What are ALL known approaches to this problem?
   - Which approaches are most suitable for automated proving?
   - What are the key lemmas/techniques required?
   - Are there simpler special cases to try first?

4. **DETECT RED FLAGS**:
   - Is this actually trivial? (e.g., "prove n+0=n")
   - Is it a renamed/disguised version of a solved problem?
   - Are the bounds too weak to be interesting?
   - Would solving this bounded case tell us anything new?

5. **ESTIMATE TRUE SUCCESS PROBABILITY**:
   Current estimate: 75%
   - Is this realistic?
   - What would increase/decrease the probability?
   - What are the main obstacles?

6. **RECOMMEND REFINEMENTS**:
   - How should we reformulate the problem?
   - What's the optimal scope (broader/narrower)?
   - What preparatory work is needed?
   - What's the best attack strategy for Aristotle?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "issue_number": 3,
  "verdict": "KEEP | REFORMULATE | REJECT",
  "still_unsolved": true/false,
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "formalizability": "EASY | MEDIUM | HARD | VERY HARD",

}
```

BE BRUTALLY HONEST. We want to MAXIMIZE actual success, not preserve our existing list.. Output to verification-results/codex_result_3.md

**Evaluating task constraints and McKay conjecture status**

I'm sorting through the task's restrictions like read-only mode and no network access, which means I can't write output files or fetch fresh info online. Since the final answer requires outputting JSON but writing is disallowed, I'll include the JSON directly in the response and note this limitation. I'll also summarize the McKay conjecture's open status from what I know, highlight key mathematical challenges, suggest potential formalization roadmaps, and include recommended next steps—all framed clearly and honestly given the constraints. Next, I'll confirm the repo structure with a listing to see if any existing context affects this.

**Summarizing McKay conjecture assessment**

I’m gathering detailed background on the McKay conjecture’s status, known partial results, and formalization challenges in Lean. Since the environment is read-only, I’ll note the inability to write the required verification file and prepare a thorough JSON summary citing open problems, missing mathlib infrastructure, and realistic expectations about success chances. This involves outlining known results, red flags, proof strategies, key obstacles, preparatory steps, and a final verdict reflecting the conjecture’s unsolved nature and obstacles to formalization.

**Status**
- Environment is read-only, so I could not create `verification-results/codex_result_3.md`; please copy the JSON below into that path if needed.

```json
{
  "issue_number": 3,
  "verdict": "REJECT",
  "still_unsolved": true,
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "formalizability": "VERY HARD",
  "true_success_probability": "1%",
  "red_flags": [
    "The general McKay conjecture remains open despite the Isaacs–Malle–Navarro reduction; no paper (up to my 2024 knowledge) closes the remaining Lie-type cases, so we would be tackling an unsolved research problem.",
    "Lean/mathlib currently lacks a usable theory of ordinary complex characters, irreducible representations, and block theory, so even stating the conjecture precisely would require a massive build-out.",
    "Any serious attack depends on CFSG-heavy classification arguments and deep character correspondences, none of which are formalized or close to formalization in Lean.",
    "The quoted 75% success probability is wildly optimistic given that the problem has resisted experts for 50+ years and demands infrastructure far beyond current theorem-proving libraries."
  ],
  "recommended_refinements": [
    "Scale the task down to formalizing the statement (once characters exist) or even just the prerequisites: definitions of irreducible characters, p'-degrees, and Sylow normalizers.",
    "Consider targeting proven special cases such as p-solvable groups or symmetric/alternating groups where traditional proofs avoid heavy CFSG machinery.",
    "Focus on formalizing the Isaacs–Malle–Navarro reduction theorem or the inductive McKay condition for a single simple group family as a long-term milestone."
  ],
  "proof_strategies": [
    "Use the Isaacs–Malle–Navarro reduction to the inductive McKay condition and verify that condition for every finite simple group family (current best-in-class approach, but relies heavily on CFSG).",
    "Construct explicit character correspondences via local block theory/perfect isometries for each relevant simple group family (methods of Späth, Malle, Navarro, etc.).",
    "For very small groups, perform computational checks via GAP character tables to gain evidence or prove minor cases (useful only for toy examples, not the conjecture)."
  ],
  "key_obstacles": [
    "Mathlib lacks ordinary character theory, complex representations, and the machinery to talk about degrees of irreducible characters.",
    "Formal proofs would need CFSG-level facts and the classification of finite simple groups, none of which are formalized.",
    "Even informal proofs for remaining cases are unfinished, so there is nothing currently available to formalize."
  ],
  "preparatory_steps": [
    "Extend mathlib with complex finite-dimensional representations, characters, irreducibility predicates, and equivalence between representations and class functions.",
    "Implement a robust API for Sylow subgroups, normalizers, and counting arguments for p'-degree irreducibles.",
    "Formalize character theory for solvable and symmetric groups to validate the new infrastructure on manageable cases.",
    "Develop an interface (or certified import) for character tables or block invariants if computational data is ever needed."
  ],
  "reasoning": "Network access is disabled, so I relied on the current literature status (up to 2024) where the McKay conjecture remains open except for specific primes (e.g., p = 2) and certain finite simple groups. The Isaacs–Malle–Navarro reduction shows that it would suffice to verify the inductive McKay condition for every simple group; this has been completed for alternating and many Lie-type families but not universally, so the global conjecture is still unsolved. Lean/mathlib presently lacks ordinary character theory infrastructure, making even the precise statement a major undertaking, and any eventual proof would require formalizing CFSG-driven character correspondences that are far beyond the state of the art. Consequently, the claimed 75% success probability is unrealistic; a more honest estimate is near zero until substantial foundational work is completed. The task should therefore be rejected or drastically reformulated toward attainable milestones."
```

Next steps (if you want to proceed) could be:
1. Decide whether to downscope the issue to something like “define irreducible characters in mathlib” or “formalize McKay for p-solvable groups”.
2. Once scope is clear, lift the read-only restriction so the result file can be written.
