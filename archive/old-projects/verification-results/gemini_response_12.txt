To address the verification task for "Issue #12: Boolean Schur Number S(4)", I have conducted a search to confirm the status of Schur number $S(4)$.

### **Findings**
1.  **Status**: **SOLVED**. The Schur number $S(4)$ is known toThe problem as stated corresponds to the classical Schur Number $S(4)$, which is a solved problem.

The Schur number $S(k)$ is defined as the smallest integer $n$ such that every $k$-coloring of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $a+b=c$.
Known values:
*   $S(1) = 2$
*   $S(2) = 5$
*   $S(3) = 14$
*   $S(4) = 45$ (Solved/Known for decades, e.g., Baumert 1965).
*   $S(5) = 161$ (Solved by Heule in 2017 using SAT solving).

The term "Boolean Schur Number" in the title likely refers to the use of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers to find these numbers, or is a conflation with the "Boolean Pythagorean Triples" problem (also solved). The problem statement provided ("4-coloring of {1,2,...,n}...") is the standard definition of $S(4)$.

Since the problem is long solved, it is not a candidate for a research breakthrough.
