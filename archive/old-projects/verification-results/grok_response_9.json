The problem statement appears accurate, but its broad scope makes it challenging to tackle directly.\n\nFormalizing this problem in Lean 4 is rated as HARD due to the complexity of defining and working with 3-absorbing and strongly 3-absorbing ideals. While some necessary definitions might be available in Mathlib, significant additions would be required to fully formalize the problem.\n\nKnown approaches to this problem are limited, with most literature focusing on general properties of absorbing ideals rather than the specific conjecture. Potential strategies include algebraic manipulation, localization techniques, and exploring connections with prime ideals and primary decomposition. However, none of these approaches have been fully developed for this specific conjecture.\n\nThe true success probability is estimated at 30%, lower than the initial 50%, due to the lack of clear proof strategies and the difficulty in formalizing the problem. This probability could be increased by narrowing the scope to specific classes of rings or ideals, and by developing more precise definitions that can be formalized in Lean 4.\n\nRed flags include the broadness of the problem, the lack of established approaches, and the difficulty in formalization. To maximize the chances of success, it is recommended to reformulate the problem by focusing on specific cases or classes of rings, and to conduct preparatory work to develop the necessary formal definitions and explore related results in the literature.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":618,"completion_tokens":720,"total_tokens":1338,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":618,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
