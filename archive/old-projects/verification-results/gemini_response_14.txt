The goal of "Brocard's Conjecture for $p_n, n \le 1000$" is to verify a specific mathematical statement for a bounded range.

### Assessment
1.  **Solved Status**: The statement for $n Error when talking to Gemini API Full report available at: /var/folders/tv/mjd7bwd918b7745mldgg045w0000gn/T/gemini-client-error-Turn.run-sendMessageStream-2025-12-11T10-22-49-339Z.json

n** task.
3.  **Formalizability**: This is **EASY** to formalize in Lean 4. It involves:
    *   Defining the $n$-th prime.
    *   Constructing the intervals $(p_n^2, p_{n+1}^2)$.
    *   Counting primes in those intervals.
    *   Proving the count is $\ge 4$ for $n=2$ to $1000$.
    *   Since $p_{1000} = 7919$ and $p_{1000}^2 \approx 6.2 \times 10^7$, the numbers are small enough for efficient computational tactics (like `native_decide` or efficient primality certificates) but might be slow for pure logical derivation without optimization.
4.  **Value**: As a research problem, it has **zero value** (it is a known fact). As a **benchmark** for an AI's ability to mix computation and deduction in Lean 4, it has **high value**.

### Verdict
I will classify this as **REFORMULATE** because while the "problem" is solved, the *task* of formalizing it is valid and achievable with 100% success rate, provided it's framed correctly (as a verification benchmark, not a research breakthrough). If the goal of the project is strictly "New Mathematics", this must be **REJECTED**. Assuming the goal includes "formalizing math", I will reformulate.
