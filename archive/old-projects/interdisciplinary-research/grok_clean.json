They are suitable for the Aristotle automated theorem prover due to their discrete nature and the availability of existing formalizations in areas such as quantum computing, quantum information theory, and complexity theory. Solving any of these problems would have a significant impact on the advancement of quantum technologies and our understanding of the power of quantum computation.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":467,"completion_tokens":3290,"total_tokens":3757,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":467,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_fced99f24f"}
