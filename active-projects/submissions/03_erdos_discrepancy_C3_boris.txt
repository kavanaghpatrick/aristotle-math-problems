# Erdős Discrepancy Problem for C = 3

## Goal

Determine the maximum length of a ±1 sequence with discrepancy less than 3.

## Problem Statement

Given a sequence x₁, x₂, x₃, ... where each xᵢ ∈ {-1, +1}, the discrepancy of the sequence is:

sup_{d,k≥1} |∑_{j=1}^{k} x_{j·d}|

This measures the maximum imbalance along any arithmetic progression with common difference d.

## The Erdős Discrepancy Conjecture

Erdős conjectured (1932) that for any ±1 sequence, the discrepancy is unbounded.

This was proved by Tao in 2015 using entropy methods.

## The Computational Question

For fixed C, what is the maximum length N such that a ±1 sequence of length N exists with discrepancy < C?

## Known Results

- C = 2: Maximum N = 1,160 (Konev-Lisitsa 2014, using SAT solver)
- C = 3: Maximum N is UNKNOWN (open problem)

## Your Task

Either:
1. Find a ±1 sequence of length N > 130,000 with discrepancy < 3
2. Prove an upper bound on the maximum length for C = 3
3. Determine the exact maximum N for discrepancy < 3

## Constraints

- Sequence elements xᵢ ∈ {-1, +1}
- For all d ≥ 1 and k ≥ 1: |∑_{j=1}^{k} x_{j·d}| < 3
- This means |∑_{j=1}^{k} x_{j·d}| ≤ 2 for all arithmetic progressions

## You Decide

- SAT encoding strategy
- Sequence construction method
- Symmetry breaking techniques
- Proof approach for upper bound

## Verification

A valid sequence of length N must satisfy:
- For every d from 1 to N
- For every k from 1 to ⌊N/d⌋
- The partial sum |x_d + x_{2d} + ... + x_{kd}| ≤ 2

## Context

- C = 2 case was a major SAT solver achievement (2014)
- Problem is equivalent to a large SAT instance
- Konev-Lisitsa's UNSAT proof for N = 1,161, C = 2 was 13GB
- Structure suggests patterns exist for larger C values

## Why This Problem

- Pure SAT problem - Aristotle's proven strength
- Finite verification - check all arithmetic progressions
- Clear success criteria
- Extends landmark 2014 result
