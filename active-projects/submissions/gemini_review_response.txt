Here is the review of the 5 Boris-style submissions.

## **1. MOLS(10) - Three Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares**
*   **Problem Accuracy**: **OK**. The definition and open status (unknown for $n=10$) are mathematically precise.
*   **Open Status**: **CONFIRMED**. Open since the 1960s. $n=10$ is the smallest case where the maximum number of MOLS is unknown ($2 \le N(10) \le 9$).
*   **Boris Compliance**: **5/5**. Extremely minimal. "You decide" covers construction vs. impossibility.
*   **Success Probability**: **<1%**. This is a notorious combinatorial monster. Enormous search space ($10!^{20}$ scale). However, it is the perfect "Grand Challenge" for a system that claims to solve open problems.
*   **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
*   **Critical Fixes**: None.

## **2. R(5,5) Exact Value**
*   **Problem Accuracy**: **OK**.
*   **Open Status**: **CONFIRMED**. Bounds $43 \le R(5,5) \le 46$ are current as of Sept 2024 (Angeltveit & McKay).
*   **Boris Compliance**: **5/5**.
*   **Success Probability**: **5%**. Finding the *exact* value is likely out of reach (computationally "alien" scale). However, **improving the bounds** (e.g., finding a coloring for 43 or proving 46 is impossible) is a tractable, high-value SAT task.
*   **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
*   **Critical Fixes**: None. The goal "Determine the exact value" is ambitious but fits the "You decide" philosophy (Aristotle can decide to just improve a bound).

## **3. Erdős Discrepancy C=3**
*   **Problem Accuracy**: **OK**.
*   **Open Status**: **CONFIRMED**. $C=2$ solved in 2014 ($N=1160$). $C=3$ is widely open and likely much larger.
*   **Boris Compliance**: **5/5**.
*   **Success Probability**: **25%**. This is a "Pure SAT" problem, which aligns perfectly with Aristotle's proven success on SAT LRAT. Even if the exact limit is unreachable, finding a sequence $> 2000$ or proving a new upper bound would be a publishable result.
*   **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
*   **Critical Fixes**: None.

## **4. Extremal Self-Dual Code [72,36,16]**
*   **Problem Accuracy**: **OK**.
*   **Open Status**: **CONFIRMED**. A famous open problem in coding theory.
*   **Boris Compliance**: **5/5**.
*   **Success Probability**: **10%**. Search space is massive, but algebraic constraints (automorphism groups) make it more structured than MOLS(10).
*   **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
*   **Critical Fixes**: None.

## **5. Union-Closed Sets (Frankl) N=13**
*   **Problem Accuracy**: **OK**.
*   **Open Status**: **CONFIRMED**. Verified for $n \le 12$. $n=13$ is the next frontier.
*   **Boris Compliance**: **5/5**.
*   **Success Probability**: **15%**. Exhaustive search is impossible (trillions of families). Success depends on Aristotle generating a clever non-exhaustive verification strategy or finding a counter-example.
*   **Verdict**: **APPROVE**
*   **Critical Fixes**: None.

## **LAUNCH RECOMMENDATION**

Based on "Aristotle's proven strength" (SAT LRAT success) and the "Boris Pattern" data:

**#1. Erdős Discrepancy C=3**
*   **Why**: It is explicitly a "Pure SAT" problem, matching the system's verified capability. The metric is continuous (length of sequence), allowing for partial credit/progress even if the full solution isn't found immediately.
*   **Action**: **SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY.**

**#2. R(5,5)**
*   **Why**: Recent activity (Sept 2024) makes this a high-profile target. It is also a SAT-heavy problem.
*   **Action**: Submit second.

**#3. MOLS(10)**
*   **Why**: The "Moonshot". Low probability, but highest glory.
*   **Action**: Submit to background queue.
